I just upgraded my home gaming setup
0:02
to LG's 42-inch C2 and something about it.
0:06
It finally went well, what the hell?
0:09
I have it set to one minute, this is what I'm talking about.
0:11
I just upgraded my home gaming setup to LG's 42-inch C2
0:16
and some things about it are great.
0:18
Basically, zero motion blur in key OLED blacks
0:22
and the size is perfect.
0:24
But, using a TV as your monitor is less perfect.
0:28
Thankfully, ASUS ROG who sponsored this video
0:32
has the solution.
0:33
This PG42UQ they sent over has all the same benefits
0:36
of my existing display,
0:38
but none of the drawbacks of using a TV.
0:41
It's got display port 1.4 alongside its HDMI 2.1 connection.
0:45
I no longer need a companion app.
0:47
So my display will go to sleep
0:48
and wake up alongside my system.
0:50
And best of all,
0:52
I can disable that accursed auto dimming function
0:56
for a much more consistent experience.
0:59
To say, I can't wait, would be an understatement.
1:01
On paper, it's basically the perfect gaming display,
1:05
but just 'cause it's sponsored,
1:06
doesn't mean I'm not gonna tell you guys
1:07
if I don't run into any problems.
1:09
(upbeat electro music)
1:18
Right out of the gate, massive shout-out
1:20
the developer of LGTV companion
1:22
because it's a lot better than not having it,
1:25
but this was set to sleep after a minute.
1:28
It has been like five minutes and it's not asleep.
1:32
Also, there's no way to minimize it.
1:34
So you just,
1:36
I can just tuck it away.
1:38
Also, you guys notice, right when I moved that box,
1:40
the brightness changed dramatically.
1:42
You can adjust that behavior
1:44
with a special service remote in the hidden menu,
1:46
but you can't disable it entirely.
1:49
Probably the thing that's annoyed me the most though,
1:51
aside from coming back to the office right
1:55
after setting this one up
1:56
and seeing the better solution sitting in our warehouse,
1:58
is that I have been stuck at 60 hertz
2:02
because my computer is so far away
2:04
that I need an active optical cable
2:06
in order to get a signal to it.
2:08
And while there are HDMI 2.1 active cables available, woo.
2:14
In my case, the cable is so costly,
2:16
that since I already own a long display port anyway,
2:20
even if the monitor version is a little more expensive,
2:23
it's a better bet.
2:24
ASUS sent over not one but three of these,
2:27
which means that with some help from these little doodads,
2:29
which let you extend a USB connection
2:32
over standard ethernet cabling,
2:34
I will be able to show you guys the final form
2:36
of my centralized gaming system.
2:39
Where it shouldn't matter,
2:41
if I sit down at it here, sit down at it downstairs,
2:44
the experience should be identical, no additional latency.
2:48
[Plouffe] I can help you lift it when it gets to that-
2:49
I know it's super basic.
2:50
Yeah, why do I need to follow the instructions?
2:52
Geoff just told me that we've gotta do this alright?
2:56
And it's sponsored, so I'm trying to make sure we do it.
2:59
No, I open boxes how I please.
3:00
[Plouffe] Oh my God. Oh my God.
3:03
All right, there's a stand.
3:04
[Plouffe] Yep. Nice.
3:06
Ooh, accessory pouch.
3:07
[Plouffe] Yeah, I actually really like that.
3:08
Complete with color calibration report.
3:10
Oh my goodness.
3:11
Their calibration report comes in a little sleeve.
3:14
Ooh.
3:16
Power.
3:18
Display port.
3:19
HDMI.
3:20
USB.
3:22
[David] It's really weird.
3:23
The instructions said specifically throw cables over your
3:25
left shoulder.
3:25
[Plouffe] Yeah.
3:26
Did they really?
3:27
[Plouffe] Yeah.
3:28
Did they?
3:29
(laughing)
3:31
[Linus] Remote.
3:32
This is pretty handy.
3:33
I mean, it's nice to be able to turn it off
3:35
and on remotely, change sources,
3:36
all that kind of good stuff.
3:38
What else we got going here?
3:39
Okay Plouffe, do you wanna grab an edge?
3:40
[Plouffe] Okay, I'll grab the other side.
3:41
Okay, according to the instructions.
3:43
Okay, David frame them out.
3:45
[David] You're not here, you're not here!
3:48
Okay. Okay. With a helper.
3:49
Place it down like that.
3:51
That helper that definitely exists.
3:52
There's a lot going on here.
3:54
We've got vent holes up at the top. Is this a cooling fan?
3:58
No.
3:59
ASUS does advertise that it can be over clocked.
4:02
So instead of just 4K120, it'll apparently do 4K138 hertz.
4:08
But the cooling required to achieve that is all passive.
4:11
So you don't have to worry about any additional noise.
4:13
They also advertise 0.1 millisecond,
4:15
greater gray pixel response times, out of box calibration,
4:18
which I showed you already, as well as a whopping 98%
4:23
coverage of the DCI-P3 color space.
4:25
Pretty freaking impressive.
4:27
Just like our screw driver,
4:28
which is now available for order on lttstore.com,
4:31
which happens to include the hex bit.
4:32
We need to tighten up our monitor stand here.
4:34
So you use the knurling for speed.
4:36
Eh, then the handle for tightness.
4:39
Love it!
4:39
I could totally lift this myself, but ASUS insisted I have a
4:42
helper, so I've got Plouffe here taking the other end.
4:44
Thanks, Plouffe, that's really good.
4:47
All right, oh, that's super handy.
4:49
It's got a USB three port up at the top,
4:52
along with one of these little threaded majigs so that you
4:55
can put your camera or your webcam or anything else that has
4:59
one of these.
4:59
What are these 1/4 inch?
5:00
Is that the one?
5:01
[David] Yeah, 1/4 inch.
5:02
1/4 inch threaded posts on it.
5:03
Love it.
5:04
Oh, that's nice.
5:05
I was leaning this. So David could get a B roll shot here.
5:07
And it's actually got a little bit of tilt,
5:09
which is something you won't normally find on a TV.
5:12
In terms of IO, we've got, oh really?
5:14
It's got the full compliment of HDMI ports,
5:17
four of them, along with display port.
5:20
And this is a pretty robust built in USB hub.
5:22
It's got USB-3 in here and then 1, 2, 3.
5:26
I thought I saw another one somewhere, I guess three is,
5:29
oh yeah, there's another one down here.
5:30
Four USB-3 ports.
5:32
There's your headphone jack, power is here, Kensington here.
5:35
And I'm assuming this is our GB.
5:37
I guess we should plug it in and see it light up.
5:38
One thing that's conspicuously absent is E Ark.
5:41
So you're either gonna be using the onboard speakers or
5:44
speakers that are hooked up through
5:46
an AV receiver or similar.
5:47
Now this is curious.
5:49
There are a couple more threaded mounting holes here.
5:52
Plouffe, do you have any idea what these are for?
5:54
[Plouffe] No, it does vesa 300 by 300.
5:56
Well, yeah, that's here.
5:57
That's standard based amounting.
5:59
Yeah, I'm actually not sure.
6:00
I never saw anything in any of the documentations.
6:02
Yeah, they're just labeled mounting port.
6:05
Oh, that's cool though.
6:06
[Plouffe] Yeah.
6:07
If you didn't happen to have an LTT screw driver,
6:08
it does include a little allen key for the stand.
6:10
So that's neat.
6:11
It uses a little center mounted nubbin nipple thing
6:14
for control, so I think I just turned it on.
6:16
The RGB is not on by default.
6:20
[Plouffe] I don't know.
6:20
ASUS ROG, who are you?
6:22
It's got to be RGB.
6:24
This is interesting.
6:25
The HDMI one and two,
6:27
are HDMI 2.1, three and four are 2.0.
6:30
So that's good to know.
6:31
Oh no, the power button is just to the right of
6:33
the control nipple.
6:35
Okay, got it.
6:37
So did I turn it on this time?
6:39
If I'm gonna fall off this desk?
6:41
I think we all wanna see it on camera.
6:43
[David] Watch your back pocket cause you're with the side
6:45
of the screwdriver.
6:45
[Plouffe] Oh my God. Yes.
6:46
Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry. I'm good.
6:47
I'm good. I'm good.
6:48
[David] Do you wanna hand that to Plouffe?
6:49
Yeah, Plouffe.
6:50
Okay, yeah, there we go.
6:51
Yeah, yeah.
6:52
[David] Why are you doing it like this?
6:53
So heavy.
6:53
Oh wow.
6:55
There we go, yeah.

Whenever we see china in the news it’s normally for some impressive statistic about building
0:04
stuff, or how it is now home to the most millionaires in the world, or maybe it’s even an article
0:09
about whatever geopolitical tomfoolery they are trying to pull this week.
0:12
But what is often forgotten about this is that behind the somewhat intimidating outward
0:17
appearance of economic might and glistening skyscrapers, china is an extremely poor country.
0:24
This almost sounds a bit paradoxical given the wealth that is so evident from the outside.
0:29
Never the less average incomes in China are still less than $15,000 USD’s per year,
0:34
and that’s average, so in a nation that reports a Gini coefficient of 0.47 with some
0:40
independent research noting this could be as high as 0.73 that mean’s there are a
0:45
lot of poor people at home in this economic miracle.
0:48
In plain English, this means upwards of half a billion people in China are living on less
0:53
than $10 per day, primarily made up of those still living in rural areas.
0:58
Now this fact is not lost on the Chinese government, who know that a growing wealth divide in their
1:04
worker’s paradise is not a great look, especially if that divide is between the cities fueling
1:08
growth and the farmers feeding them.
1:10
That is why in just the last 5 years the government has poured the equivalent of over 800 billion
1:16
dollars into aid in area’s where extreme poverty is still commonplace. This is to say
1:22
nothing on state-owned enterprises which easily bring this running total to over a trillion
1:26
dollars in the same time period.
1:28
A trillion dollars in 5 years, that’s more than the entire GDP of 3 quarters of the world’s
1:34
countries, on one single welfare project.
1:37
Even for a government as wealthy as China’s, this is ultimately not sustainable.
1:42
So a new solution was needed to make these systems more efficient at solving core issues
1:47
rather than alleviating the symptoms with handfuls of cash.
1:51
And there might be a lot to take away from what they have done so as always we need to
1:55
understand a few things.
1:58
How much poverty is there actually left in china?
2:01
Why is this so difficult to measure?
2:03
Why does China care so much?
2:06
And how might cows be the solution to this whole problem?
2:12
Intro Add
2:20
Now poverty is one of those things that is surprisingly
2:30
hard to quantify which is the first real issue for governments that are trying to address
2:34
this issue.
2:36
Incomes are the most used metric, and almost every statistic you have likely heard on the
2:39
issue will say something like these people live on less than 2 dollars a day, and for
2:44
what it’s worth we have done exactly the same thing already in this video.
2:48
But there are two problems with this, the first is that some people can be extremely
2:53
comfortable with not much income.
2:55
Some retirees would be a good example of this. They might own their own home fully paid off
3:00
and have a nice pile of cash savings so they are very comfortable, but with interest rates
3:04
as low as they are they might technically have an income below the internationally accepted
3:08
poverty line.
3:09
An asset means test can address this situation but then what if they own nothing live with
3:14
affluent children as is commonplace in China.
3:17
It’s not impossible to work around but it is difficult, meaning more money is going
3:22
to go to auditors and government middlemen rather than the people who really need it,
3:26
especially when we are talking about a population as large as china’s, with let’s be honest
3:31
a pinch of corruption.
3:32
The second problem is purchasing power parity, or PPP.
3:36
$20 per day in rural China or most countries in Southeast Asia and Africa would afford
3:42
you a pretty comfortable lifestyle, but $20 per day in San Fransisco, Sydney or London
3:49
would pretty much make you destitute.
3:50
It’s for this reason that measures are put in place to address the relative purchasing
3:55
power of a dollar in a region.
3:57
For example, a week’s worth of groceries might cost $5 in rural farming villages because
4:03
the grocer’s overheads are lower due to lower staff salaries, lower rent or cost to
4:07
own a premises, and lower transport costs on account of them being in and amongst where
4:11
the food is made.
4:12
If we compare that to one of our ritzy global cities where even a similarly modest grocery
4:17
trip would cost $50, you can see that a dollar in rural china has 10 times the purchasing
4:23
power so even if someone was to earn 1/10th as much money they could live a similar lifestyle
4:28
right?
4:29
Well that’s the theory, but unfortunately it is a wildly outdated way of thinking
4:35
And here’s why
4:37
ADD
4:38
While it’s true that purchasing power parity can afford similar lifestyles in two totally
4:43
isolate economic systems with two totally isolated sets of inputs and outputs this is
4:48
just not how the real world works in the age of globalization.
4:52
Take something like a phone. These devices have changed how we have lived our lives and
4:57
are incredible tools for communicating and having access to information wherever it is

So today we're going to be doing a software engineering lecture.
00:02
This is a somewhat of an experiment.
00:04
So I'm going to give you some backscorian why it's happening.
00:06
So an interesting note that in 2003-ish and earlier,
00:12
61A had two days a week, Monday,
00:15
Wednesdays of technical topics,
00:17
and then Friday was always something else.
