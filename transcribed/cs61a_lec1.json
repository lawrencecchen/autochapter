  "text": " All right, okay, is this projection at all? Can everyone hear me? I'm here back. We get awesome. All right, so welcome everyone to the first lecture of CS61A. Yeah! Well, I'm so glad that got a response. So this is, I'm super glad to see this lecture in so full. So let's just go ahead and jump in to the first lecture. Before we talk about anything relating to computer science, first we're going to talk about six women as a class starting with the six women A community. So first of all, hi, my name's Chris. I'm going to be one of your instructors. My pronouns are they them. And I've been teaching six women A for a while. I've been a TA for five semesters involved a bit before that. And this is my first time as an instructor for this course. So I'm really excited. Some might interest within computer science, our computational biology, and programming languages. So if you want to talk about that or really anything the course you can feel free to reach out. I'm going to go ahead and pass around this mic. There's going to be a little bit of like some noise is going on. Let's see. Yeah. My name's Kitten. This is, I'll be one of your other lectures in summary. This is my eight hand teaching the course. So my first hand lecture in terms of computer science. But I can just take three computers at your degree and add some research in other material and now. So if you find yourself interested in that later on, the course will treat talk to me. Also, this is a really difficult course. So we're all here to talk to you about anything if you've ever anything. So let's take a look at the email. I'm going to talk about one of the other three instructors. My research interests are kind of programming with design as well as the applications that see if education in particular. This is also taught at Fairmount. Excited. Cool. All right. So I'll take this back. So if you ever want to contact us, you should email us at CS61A plus SU19. At Berkeley.edu. If you email us there, you'll be able to all three of us will see that. So that's the best way to contact us. You can also reach out to us individually if you have something pertaining to one of us as individuals. But this is the email you should be looking at for the most part. So we're in struck. Yeah. Coming in, there's a lot of seats on this side. So feel free to go in on the other entry. And those are like seats in the first. Maybe if you're in the middle area, we can like split together a little bit. Really, you should come from the edge. Yeah, there's a seat next to you and you can move to the center. Let's do that. So people coming in can give that. Awesome. I'll give like a minute for the noise to settle here. All right. So you've met us. We're going to be your instructors. But there's just three of us and there's like 400 plus of you in this room. So there's no way we can do all this by ourselves, which is why we have a wonderful team of TAs as well as tutors. So TAs are responsible for running, lab and discussion sections. You'll see them in office hours. Tutors are responsible for running smaller group tutoring sections, which we'll talk about a little bit later. But both TAs and tutors are going to be the people you're going to be interacting with most often throughout the course. So with that in mind, we have a bunch of them up here on stage. So I'm going to go ahead and try to pass down the mic. When you get it, if you can just give your name your role. Oh, I guess I'll go. Yeah. Yeah. If you can come down here and pass it down. Yeah. So I have like two cables to have to run me down. It's a lot of fun. Okay. I have one. I want to go to TAs. I have an algorithm. I'll take the target in the grading. So I'll get the Y as you may actually have an algorithm. And then I'll also be doing a little bit of the, that these two on these sides, so maybe this is not a couple to many. But we have a piece of the mon on my name is up to this order. Do you think about that? Do you think you can be checking the data? Hello. I'm Richard. I took six to my last summer. I'm going to be a TAs summer. I'm really excited to be a TAs. I'm Ryan. I'm one of the other Hathias. And I'm your content for the project. Hello. My name is Jay Zarr. I'm going to be TAs summer. And you can feel free to come back in the morning, second. Hi. I'm Olivia. I'm a TAs. And I'm going to just, Hello. I'm Ryan. I'm also TAs. I'm going to be working on the online content as well. Welcome. I'm a TAs. Hi. I'm Michelle. I'm talking with Olivia. I'm a little bit just six. I'm going to be a second time. Hi, I'm Jennifer. I'm a student from class. I'm also a TAs. Woo! Wow. Good. All right. You all can free to head back in the morning. Yeah. All right. Okay. So again, these tutors and TAs are going to be the people you're going to be interacting with. The most throughout the semester. So once you start going to lab and discussion, these are the people that you should be sure to get to know. And they'll be the best people to handle most of your questions and concerns in this course. In addition to TAs and tutors, we also have a very large group of academic interns. Academic interns are students who usually recently took the class. And they'll be helping out in your lab and office hours sections to give you some help with the assignments. This is like a very small subset of the people we'll have helping out as AI's over the summer. So you'll be seeing a lot of those as well. And then in addition to TAs, tutors, instructors and academic interns, we have the most important people in this course, all of you. Yeah. Very much not used to all this applause, but I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Comes with the job, I guess. So yeah. Over the summer, this is by far the largest group of students we've ever had for summer course. Across the in-person, 61A in online, 610 sections, we have over 650 people in role in this course. And I'm all of us are really, really excited to be able to work with all of you and put on a great class this semester. Really excited to be able to talk to you and work with you through all of this. So with that, let's start talking about 61A in particular. So 61A is a class in the computer science department for many of you. It might be your first computer science class. So what is computer science? Computer science is a very broad field. But in general, computer science is the study of different problems that can be solved using computation. So all computation means is that you do some series of steps, maybe you're doing some math or just, following some instructions to be able to get some result. This doesn't even need to be done with computers. In fact, in the early days, if you just had someone right in a bunch of math, you might even call them computers. But more specifically, computer science is how do you take these problems and solve the different approaches for being able to solve these problems. So there are a bunch of different ways you can approach different problems. A bunch of different ways you can solve them with computation. And computer science talks about some of those different approaches. In particular, we are interested in the techniques that lead to the most effective solutions. So of course, some solutions will take more time or require more resources and others. So we're interested in the solutions that are going to be the most effective. One other thing to note is that not all problems can be solved effectively through computation. For example, a lot of problems out there will require you to actually, I don't know, interact with people. And those tasks aren't very easily solved by just a list of steps you can blindly follow. So it's important to note that computer science doesn't tell you how to solve every problem. But there's a great variety of problems that it can solve and we're interested in effective solutions for those problems. So what are some of these different problems that you can solve? So there are systems like operating systems, compilers, artificial intelligence, graphics, so on and so forth. There's a big long list. These are just a subset of the interests that people at Berkeley have as their research interests. But just about any of these topics, if you're interested in, you can ultimately take a class and have Berkeley or elsewhere. By the way, if you're sitting in the back, we still do have quite a few seats on this side of the room if you want to move over and not clog up the rows. So, do you use quite a poly-exiting and then going through the other entrance? There's another door on this side, so if you exit the ground. Of course. So that's computer science. What is 6-1-8 in particular about? Well, it's about managing complexity. So a lot of these problems can have really complicated and large solutions. And one important skill to be able to have is how to take these solutions and express them in a really simple and effective way. One of the ways we teach this in this course is through mastering abstraction. So what abstraction means is for most things you run across, you don't need to know exactly how they work. You can take some of the complicated details and well abstract them away. So for example, when you're interacting with other people when you see human being, you don't see them as a collection of cells or, you know, like a bunch of chemical processes happening, you interact with them as humans. So you abstract away all those chemical and biological processes and view them as a human. With programs, instead of looking at the very, you know, my new details of what's going on, we'll see different ways to group them and abstract them. One of those ways is by exposing you to different programming paradigms. So programming paradigms are just different ways to approach writing programs. And a lot of these have very general abstract differences. So across this course, we'll be exposing you to imperative, declarative, functional, several different types of programming. And these are different ways that you can organize your program and help manage its complexity. Of course, 61A, again, is many of your first computer science classes, so we also hope for it to serve as an introduction to program. So we'll hope that we can give you a pretty full understanding of Python fundamentals. After you go through this course, you should be able to do a lot in Python. We also take a lot of smaller ideas that will teach in lecture and discussion in lab and combine those into larger projects, which is an important skill to be able to have when you're in the real world, because most of what you're going to be doing is large projects. And finally, we'll talk a little bit about how computers interpret programming languages. So when you write code, how does your computer actually take that code and how is it able to run it? In the beginning of the course, we'll talk about this more mechanically, so we'll have you actually do some of the interpretation yourself. But later in the course, we'll talk about how computers can interpret programming languages automatically. And finally, this is a challenging course that will demand a lot from you. The pace of this course is very fast, there's going to be a lot of assignments. However, if you do choose to stick with this class, we have a lot of resources available and we do really want you to succeed. So please don't understand the pace and difficulty of this class, but also understand that there's a lot of things available for you if you want to stick with this class. That being said, this class isn't the right first programming or computer science class for everyone. And with that in mind, there are a couple of alternatives to CS61A that you might want to keep in mind. So the first one is CS10 called the beauty and joy of computing. CS10 is designed for students who do not have prior experience. So even though in 61A, we try to make the course such that you can still succeed. Even if you don't have prior programming experience, I didn't have prior programming experience when I took the course, for example. However, CS10 is specifically designed for students without prior experience. So for some students, this is a better fit for your first class. This is an introduction to some of the fundamentals of computer science. It does go over some Python, although some of the classes also in a language called SNAP, which is more visual language. But after going through CS10, you'll know a lot of the concepts and Python fundamentals that you'll need for 61A. Right now it has a shortest weight list and over the summer it has been taught by Matthew and Monsy. So you can see more info at cs10.org. There's also data eight, which is the foundations of data science. So data eight goes over the fundamentals of computing, of statistical inference and some a little bit of machine learning. Apply to real world data sets. So the purpose of data eight is a little bit different than CS61A. CS61A is a class about computer science. Data eight is a class about data science, which is a little bit different because it's more concerned with how you process data. But there is still quite a bit of overlap. It does feature more statistics than computer science. However, the programming is in 61A, so it is a good exposure to Python if you want to take that before 61A. If you want to enroll, it's listed as cs8, although it's referred to as data eight. It has a little bit of a larger weight list, but it has been taught over the summer by Natalia and Francie. It's actually the lecture right before this one, so you'll probably run to them as they're exiting the hall. All right, so more info at date eight.org. So I'm going to go ahead and hand it off to Tiffany to talk a little bit about the course logistics. Again, pardon me as there's a little bit of noise here. We're trying to get screencasts for most of these lectures, which means we need both the mic to project and another mic to report. It's a little bit of technical setup. What's talking about that in the minute? So I'm going to talk about course format and coffee logistics. First off, this course has a lot of different components. As you're experiencing right now, there's a lecture that'll be every Monday through Thursday at 11am in this room. Lectures where you're going to be those to course material for the first time. You strongly encourage you to come at person, so you see a lecture before you discussion. Because generally, although you're changing the very kind and we'll be leaning, discussion is most effective if you've seen the relevant lecture beforehand. It's also what? Discussion and all the sounds. The reason that these are all labeled most important part of the course is because really depends on the student and the courage you will. You should really complete all of them, and you'll see that probably one of them will be the most effective for your learning. A lot of the plays where you'll usually, after lecture before discussion, you're going to actually interact with your machine, to do some programming in the soda labs. This is where you'll get to interact with a lot of concepts for the first time. In discussion, you're going to actually be working on pen and paper. And you might be wondering, why do I do that? This is because this course is actually quite theoretical. This is in a programming course. You will learn programming over the course of the course, but that was not meant to be like a hot rye. But that isn't the focus. The focus is giving you a foundation and a computer cycle. And that's why discussion where you go over questions with a pen and paper is a really fundamental part of the course. It happens after a lot of things, when you're going to read the document. All the flowers are where you can drop by to ask any questions, oftentimes will come with. Cyber questions because the assignments are very challenging. This is where you'll interact with a lot of the academic interns as well. And then we also have an all-of-my textbook. Some students read this textbook and the chapter is associated. You'll see it on the website. Every one of you has associated text and chapters. Some students read this before lecture. Some students read this after lecture. Some students don't really text together. I don't know about the key here. Probably the text was. But we highly encourage you for a reason of your first meeting to read the textbook and see what you find helpful. Personally, I might have a textbook. And I think, because now it's the degree of the textbook. Because it's not a call. I'm not trying to say both are normal and acceptable. But ultimately, it just depends on where your learning style is. So try it out and see what works for you. And there's also a weekly summary assignments for big program projects. A bit you're in the final. And the reason we're listing all this is to say it will be very demanding. And this is where you can expect. But there also will be a lot of support along the way. Any questions? Yeah, in the front. So the program program program call is called all-extended. Yes, all you put in the program is project. You wouldn't believe it's a point. It's a point about, yeah. So there are four projects. There are a lot of means about them online. And soon you'll be able to really keep those movies. So in terms of the first week, you just logistics. Well, I will start in one day. So even if you have a Monday or Tuesday lab not happening this week, because that's just set up. Do the lab on your own, stop it all the Saturdays if you need help with set up. So this one quick announcement about labs zero. On Piazza's some viewer mentioning that you are running into some issues with labs zero. I think we found that some students running map OS are able to run labs zero. And for you, we'll let you know when you can read down loaded and it should be fixed. This is an example of debugging on the spot. It'll be a lot of shendry buggy soon. But yeah, we'll have a fix up shortly and you should keep an eye on Piazza. Turns a discussion. Discussion starts on Tuesday. And we highly encourage you to attend discussions and not to do a lot. You can see on the, These are your discussion numbers. You can see whether they're not through a lot. They should have the same pattern. The reason for this is so that you see the same Piazza and they get to know you and they'll be able to help you much more effectively. It's also better organizedationally for us. And finally, office hours will also start at Tuesday. There are no office hours today. Okay, so in terms of the pen is, We do not, so like, let's share your pen instead of all, but as I said, you highly encourage you to attend. This is our first time trying to bug past a sub-resession. So we'll try to make it as in fallogues or pen, but there are no promises around that. This is kind of an experience. So if you come in prison, it's all quality best. And historically, if you fall behind the terms of luckier, which is what often happens with students don't come to luckier, the other part of the course, no ball would become a lot more difficult. So, early 30 to come with your pen. Discussion and lapotans are in trust. And we're going to talk about what they're considering a bit. It doesn't directly come for your grace, but it comes through something called Frictid's Appation Points. And finally, all your assignments, labs, homeworks, projects, can be submitted remotely. So if you happen to be out of Berkeley for some reason, or you have an emergency, as long as you look computer on you, you should be fine. Okay, so as you make it earlier with some of your tutors, we also offer a small room tutoring section which are left by the staff at the very least. Small room sections are around 40 to 60 people, and it's good to be a more intimate environment to your view the material, but these are for the optional and their limited number of spots. So, around end of this week, we'll have sign-ups. And to make it more clear, the purpose of these sections are if any discussion is really to be argued in up your view and you would like more practice, you can sign up for one of these tutoring sections. You'll get more positive practices, supplemental material, and a small environment, so maybe you can ask more questions and feel more comfortable. So sign-ups will help next, and in this week, on Piotta. Also, we have something called conceptual office hours. So ideally, it all upstairs in the conceptual, in my dream work. But unfortunately, you ought to sign it usually that quant with the synthetic assignment question and debugging help, which is also useful, but usually doesn't get to the core of the material. The key concepts that we test in your exams, for example. So conceptual office hours are a place that are specifically reserved for no assignment help and only conceptual questions. So these will be added to the calendar soon, and you can expect to go there for that to become. So, girl is such a piece. Historically, in this course, a combination is because we look in a continuity project every single day, and it's kind of a great piece. It was doing both behind to whatever decision. It's great to offer to need you to catch back upon materials that just have. Right? Because we just keep going with your content. No such things are kind of venting to this gap, because there'll be one single week. They go from a mirror to a hundred of that once in a chaos, there's a scaffolding where she ascended with the format and you'll go to this room, with the bunch of experience working to get some of the view on depth, specific content. So as you're from two sections, then that you don't sign up. They're going to be dropping, you can go to one, you can go to all of them. And at the build session, you'll be in groups and work through this gap with it working, and hopefully by the end, you'll much more comfortable with those topics, so you might have missed early in the week. That makes sense to be running? Any questions that anything I went through so far? Yeah, I think. Is the left task going to be real for my morning, or is it going to be recorded? Recorded and posted. Alex's interesting and more about it. Yeah. So we're like, the reason we have so many microphones is because we're recording it right now. But to note, there's no guarantees on one of the screencasts will go up, and it might be that evening, it might be a day or two later. So that's, it's meant to help you review the lectures if you missed something in live lecture, but it's not meant to be a consistent replacement for live lecture. Cool. Any other questions? Yeah. We're going to be every Friday at 11 a.m. So we have lecture Monday to freezes, real sections of Friday. I think it's still in the book a room, but we'll have those details in the website too. It won't start this week. It will start like in the future. Yeah. No, we don't really have such in this week. They start second week. Okay. I'm missing it. Yes. I'm looking for it. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. So the question was, do you think the homework is changed? The focus has to learn names. Most of the knowledge will change slightly. The homeworks will be different because we're going in different ways. The numbers will not. But what if you're the problem with their share? I hope this is getting out of like, ask your friends if you're interested. That's usually a week. You're not doing that. They'll figure a lot of things. But yeah. Some of the homework columns are similar to half the number. All right. There's one more question. Yeah. Yeah. Some of the sort of real sections are 11 a.m. I'm trying to what's on. 11 to 1 p.m. I'm trying. Yeah. Okay. So we have more details on Piazza once you have the room book and what does that for happy? Yeah. We've got like halfway. Yeah. So your free to come halfway, no one will stop you. But it might because we try to keep the groups past. It'll be a moment harder. Possibly. But your free to come. Just have that in mind that it'll be a little bit more difficult to keep up. You can come halfway. Cool. So let's go a little bit and take a just a gradient route down. This is a graph of how your points are distributed. There's more details on the website. I don't want to get too into the news yet. Just to know, 140 of your points are from the exam, which we'll talk about in a bit. And 150 of your points are going to be the bottom of your points. So I've mentioned, because it's a few points earlier from the discussion about the difference. Participation points, as you may have noticed, in that 3 graph, not here. So these are the questions because they don't explicitly count towards your file. Great. If you don't want to participate, you could not participate in not going to any lab or discussion. However, we don't really encourage that. So if you're putting an effort, if you go to every lab, every discussion, you have to do below 50% of your exam. Your attendance and your participation points will help you get to the point where you're going to be. We'll help you get closer to 50%. So if you do above 50%, it won't help you at all. If you do below 50%, it'll help you at closer. If the specific or relevant use for topling this is on the website, you can like 10,000 numbers. The precise number of the sessions you want to go to, but ultimately, I encourage you to go to the sessions in the lab. The point of this is to give a credit that people work really trying to best in the course. And for some reason, it's a terrible bit of exams, but you're well at everything else. That only happens. Any questions or limitations? Yeah. If you're not going to get to the point, you're going to get to the point of the lab that we are going to go to. Yeah, you can't get to the patient credit going to a different session, but for the first two weeks, please try to go to the session year in old days, just because they'll all be quite happy. To be clear, the discussion section year in old and the lab section that matches with that discussion session. Yes. And I'm assuming. Okay. All right. So another thing I'm reading, there's going to be quite a bit of a new step for a next slide. We're almost there. Home or creating is done because of the effort. What this means is that you don't be interested in getting a part of a moment of getting a part of a more poorly threatened, especially some of the homeworks in this class. And we're very talented. And we don't want you to actually admit that there's a few more because you can't get one or two problems. Instead of how you can create it is. If you get the majority of the problems correct and we show and we see some evidence of effort for the rest of the problems. I mean, you wrote a program. We have other metrics for measuring whether you try it on our own. But for your purposes, this means good well attempts in all the problems getting those to the correct. If you do this, you won't get credit for your homework assignments. This means, like basically, in point of this, in knowing if you'd be pressured to cheat or look your friends solution and anything like that. Because if you put in your effort, keep up with the material, you should be able to get both of the homeworks just by trying to be a problem and getting those to the correct. Any questions on this because I know this might be a little confusing. Okay. Are you happy with the front? Or is someone doing the homework? Do you mind the program on the rules of the program? All those that come out and I have a framework. Yes. Can I have a whole bunch of effort with you then? So, can you ask me the front? Some of the homework and the few lines of proof, like, only if you lines of code, how do you measure effort? That's really good question. So, after you're just definitely not writing a wrongest program possible. That's not how program it works. At the good meaning, we have evidence of all your math. So, the reason I do mean details is because this one can be the way you're trying to mean the system and that's not what we want. The reason we don't be afraid of corrected is trying to make it as easy and possible. But just to give some transparency, we have, we have, you know, kind of your whole history of your homework. We see when you start, you see how many times you try, there's a lot of data there. So, we know. Oh, yeah, I hope that kind of answers the question. But if I give you, like, a zacroshole, then you can all just, I don't know, try making five submissions, then we don't know if it. And that's not really the point. I can only do this. Oh, yeah. Also, what's asking you to do it? Well, like, you can ask that one and I'll do our best to practice the homework. Yeah. Oh, okay. So, you will do what you're correct. That's a big deal. All the homework from audio-graduates. You'll know what you're correct as soon as you've found the question. In the front. Don't think that same coloring you can do is just do round-up first and have some correct answers. You can do it together. Right answer. And then correct down. Um, that's good. If you read the about page, we go more in depth into this. It's kind of hard to explain in person so you should read that first and then have any questions. Essentially, I would be going to like you abstract away how the effort creating words to kind of open earlier, but just trust and happen that the point is don't stress them again in all the problems. But try all of them. Give them a sense. All right. So projects are not being on the correctness and composition, but you will get project partners. So hopefully that ligand below to me. Where he killed it here and he can find the projects are pretty big. It's the start when they're actually posted. Can you think of them all for last minute? Labs are also bringing on completion, but you get two lab jobs. So we encourage you to put in your best effort. Um, we want to go check something. Labs are great and correctness, right? Yeah. Okay. So, kind of do about correct mission. But yeah. So we encourage you to clean all the labs and try to finish. And they're meant to be assignments that you can finish in the lab. We'll be correct. But if you end up having an off day, you have one or two, not at 100%. It's okay. You get two lab jobs. More details are on this website. Okay. So also we have slip days. There are a lot of ways you try to use. We need to use the course. One is your one, 24 hours slip day. So this can be used on homeworks and projects. We have, you know, final deadline, officially on the course website. Let's say you have some emergency situation. Then you can use your slip day and submit a day later. Uh, and you'll still. Yeah, full credit. But you can only do this one semester. One need to know is that, let's say you have a project partner. You use your slip hand on and then you partner up for grants, which is a project 3. They have a slip day, but you don't. If you will submit together a day late, you're going to get the link kind of fee, but they won't. So that's an important thing to note. Slip days are individual. They can't be shared or, uh, gift it. We don't even create such sort of really economy in this class. Okay. And it's finally these are the teacher's grants. Please make sure that your schedules are cleared. Must you have another class with a directing band complex? We cannot offer an alternate. So there will be a post for if you do have a plot to a direct conflict. How you can request an alternate that information will all be on Piazza. But otherwise, please note the exam times. Unless you have another class, we cannot make exceptions. All right. And now, let's just talk a little bit about preparing for these these exams that you're like I've been deciding a lot of fear about for the past like 20 minutes. Um, because I just want to make it clear that these exams are inventing some sort of fear. They're not meant to be too scared. The purpose of these exams are kind of like I mentioned earlier. This is quite a few replicors. And the other times the course can be a bit more practical, especially your labs and your homework. But any exams can get asking questions that get more to the core of specific concepts. For example, chair cursing which will manage the leader, trees, I know I'm only dealing with, but you really, really, we believe in things are now. But those are two big topics. These big concepts. Sometimes when we delve into them, we have to ask, create topics and problems. Really get sensitive where you are showing your understanding. So how do you say these exams? Um, generally, I think kind of this is a background for life fortune courts. And this isn't, maybe what we're for everybody, but I want to give maybe my background. And maybe the last point of view to also explain how you didn't just to give you perspectives. For me, usually, as I've ended the first week, I'm just having a virtual audience in classes. I would look at one of the first exams from maybe the past year or all of our exams are posted on the resources pages via CCS-USD today. If you can ask this one there, you can take a look. What I'm trying to say is I would look at that exam and then it'll look like complete gibberish community, right? But I want to be able to identify what are the terms that come up the most often? What are the types of problems that come up on the exam? And then we're on in lecture in discussion and lab. But when I see that term again, what I see that term is probably, I notice the super important. They also know the levels and chords. And so once I've seen a couple of those problems, I do like to now go back and try out those past exam problems. Because I've seen them before and now I know the learned material once they got to that further course. What I'm trying to get at this is just one approach. Some people don't like this because they can squirrel, they can then in my experience. I don't remember and then I looked at me once, so it really squirrels for me. But what I'm trying to get at is not putting off exam studies who we call because that'll make it a lot more stressful. If you try to package exam problems every week at the end of the fall week after Wednesday, that material, you'll find it for a lot easier to figure out how to approach them and master them and create strategies to talk to them. I also really urge you to talk to your staff about this, the TA's because they'll have their own experiences and be able to relate to more closely and your own experiences. I guess one of the things I'll mention is that all of these resources page as we get further into the course, or every topic will have specific, list of the past exam problems from that topic. So that's another way to study. So we'll talk to all right, we just went through higher responses. We'll need what the research is to do and try to pass exam problems higher responses. Yeah, Alex also needs this helpful flow chart. So what he is trying to bring in here is that you can start out with going to lecture and reading the textbook and reading the further that. Then you go to the lab, do you do the vocal homework, go to the session. After that, you still will shape you out of the class set. That's a broad section to four, also tuning sections to two lines. And then after you have a foundation, you should be ready to tell me how to subtract your exams. It won't be difficult, but the point of that little move is that you do it over and over again. I don't even need to be lecturing your tests, but I really want to encourage you to start early and I think that would really improve your experience. Cool. Any questions on exam to the resources we have for them? Yeah, you know? So is your experience known as all of ours without the help of the parent for exam? That's a good point. So conceptual officers are, they're kind of mentioned as purpose. You go to conceptual officers with classes that I'm problem and we're looking forward to helping you there. You know what's going right there out of the salaries for sure? You're free to do that as well, because conceptual or kind of specialize for this. So yes, definitely can put them. Any other questions? Cool. I'm most excited of these logistics. I think this is the last slide. Okay. So just some stuff, an academic honesty or put nicely collaboration. So this class is not clear. They're acceptance. This means that whether the ten people that's key fail because you, I'm not going to give you a scenario. No matter what happens, it doesn't make change to green that you get. So there's no incentive to use so please. So instead, what you really want to talk to is class is an environment of collaboration, helping and sharing with one another. We highly encouraging work together because really for me that's how I was doing when we get to this class. So my best friends from six to a minute. Well, I'll use this right here. And that's really the point of like this opportunity, but there is one you cannot share, code with anyone else in the course, except for your project partner or on a project that you're working together on. The only circumstance where you can look at someone else's code is what you're partnering. So sharing code with you means if you're sitting together in your door and you will get someone else's screen, can you want to help them? That's still sharing code. And it's explicitly not allowed. You run into one. Is this is where people say this all they're doing? And that's because they end up with like that copies. And you can go to 10 to such. It often happens in a programming. So please be not looking anyone else's code. We also have software for detectiveness and we won't find out what's likely to do it. So that's just a warning. Sorry, you got piece of work. Okay. So if you wanted to just read anything I just said, it's all the website. Chris, very detailed documentation. And now you can opt Alex. Okay. So now we're going to dive into the content of the course. So the first thing we're talking about is expressions. So what are expressions? So you're expressing these types of computation and evaluates to a value. So this is some way we can kind of symbolically represent or programmatically represent some sort of computation that we're going to be given. The field of mathematics has done this for a really long time. They have numbers. They represent things in a bunch of different ways. Some of the ways they put two numbers. You put a plus sign between them. Here you have some other format. You have some line between them. Our conditions really love notation. Here you put some number. You put some house over it. You can have a number. Here you just put a word and you get another value. So here you can use another language. Greek and you just suddenly have another thing. So. And there's a bunch of things. Okay. So mathematics has a lot of ways that they like to describe things because they like doing notation and having really short. And then having really short hand in the research papers. It's really hard to read. In computer science, we really like to simplify things. So in computer science, the only thing that we really care about is this one of pretty clear FFS. What this is kind of saying is that we're taking in some particular value and we're going to manipulate it in some way. Really general. It's really abstract. Take something. Change it. The function F described how we're going to change it. The input axis is just the particular value that we care about. I claim that every single one of these kind of expressions or any other sort of expression that we were might think about in math. But these can actually be represented in this F of that notation. And so we're actually going to look at this in. High-fong. Would somebody be willing to hold this so that it doesn't. It isn't working. I put on a college shirt because supposedly they work best, but apparently they work worse. I'll be yours. Thank you. Okay. So. This is my life. Is this, yes. Okay. It's a little weird though. Okay. So what I listed is I open the, this is just in Linux. It's similar in Mac and Windows you'll probably use get-bash. If I went open the Python interpreter, I type Python 3. So what this is is it's a looping mechanism where we can type in things. Python figures out what that means or what I type and then it returns a value. So for example, I can type 2019. I figure out what 2019 is. There's nothing special and we output that. The other thing we can do is we could do addition. We can output some other value. So here it's figuring out that we want to add to numbers. It calculates the addition and then put some together. We can also do addition. We can do division. We can do more addition. We can do nested equations. We can do more multiplication. And it automatically knows the sort of standard orders of operation. And it'll sort of evaluate it in the normal way that we're used to. Another thing that we can do in the sort of functional notation that I was mentioning is there's some built-in things that we can type. We can say max of two numbers. It's going to return the value that it's a maximum. The function notation just says, okay, there's something that we want to call and we're going to separate these in parentheses and put some commas between these things. This is how Python more or less knows that we're doing a function call. We can do a min. Calculates the minimum. And this is great null. But I claim that we can do everything in this function call notation. Right here we're not doing this with the addition. And it doesn't quite work that we can't just do this. It's going to give some strange error that doesn't quite make sense. We actually have to do it. It's kind of the way Python works. We have to run this line. And this is kind of the underlying behavior of how the addition and multiplication works. And it allows us to do this other format. So we can now add things together. We can multiply things together. Let me. And another thing we can do is if you ever seen in mathematics we do multiple values in a particular function. We can actually just separate them in more commas. We'll get more values. We can also nest them. And it automatically figure out the order evaluation based on the nesting structure. And so the nice part about using this call expression notation is it's very clear what goes where. We are going to evaluate the multiplication of 456 before we add to do it. We're going to figure out what that addition is before we max that in the other addition. And sort of this nest structure makes it very clear. And the first lines that we're doing. You have to kind of know the order of operations of mathematics. And maybe you're too lazy to remember that. Having this sort of consistent notation is very nice for program languages as well as computers because it just follows a simple set of rules. And it'll figure out what it is. Cool. Are there any questions about that? All right. Cool. Thank you. Maybe. Okay. So call expressions itself. We want to look kind of like how they're formatted and how they work. So a general call expression here we're saying add to and three. This whole thing is what we call a call expression. The way you kind of know there's the name of the function. There's some parentheses. There's some values separated by commas. Some terminology. We call add the operator. This is the thing that we're operating on the values. Add will do the addition. And the other things are calling operations. So operators apply to operas. We're applying add to and three. In this case, it's not a particularly complex call expression. But in the case of we saw in the demo, we saw nested structures. So each of these values can also be expressions themselves. Instead of two, I could have said mole five and six. And I could have had some other value. And it needs to sort of figure out these values before it does this kind of application. The exact way that Python goes about this is the first thing it's does is it sees this a call expression. It says, all right. I want to figure out what this evaluates to. So the first thing I'm going to do is figure out what is the operator. In this case, that's just looking up what add is. It says, okay. This is something that does addition. Take some numbers and add them together. Next thing it does is it goes through each of the operas. These are the arguments that we're plugging in. If you guys know what to is, it figures out what three is. Now that we've kind of figured out all these values. And the reason why we're doing this is because in the case I mentioned, if two is instead mole four and five, we have to figure out what four times five is before we can add four times five and three. Once we've figured out all these values, we can actually do this application. So we know what addition is. We know what two and three is. So now we can actually add two and three according to how it is. By following this very precise sort of set of rules, it allows us to understand how computers are going about to kind of calculate any arbitrary sort of value. And because it's so simple and it's these sort of three relatively simple steps, computers can follow this relatively quickly. It says, all right, I don't have to really think about how does a structured do this step, this step and then this step and I'll have the result. So learn a little bit of example. So it's add, we're adding six and four times six as well as three times five. Okay, so as people, the way we kind of approach this is we look from the inside out. The first thing that we're going to try and figure out is what's four times six? We're going to get 24. Now after this we're going to add six and 24. We're going to get 30. We're going to add multiple if you do them five. 15 and add these together and get 45. So when I look at this, I can quickly say, okay, what's the inner most call? Okay, it's four times six. So I should probably do that one first. You could also imagine saying, okay, I'll actually do three times five, then I'll do four times six and then I'll add them together as long as we're kind of building up through the levels. Computers in Python can't quite do this. It needs to have a specific set of rules. And while we're kind of as people can look at the whole thing kind of jump around and do whatever we want, programs need to follow over these specific set of rules. The way we would do this and sort of the following the three steps that we said before is we're going to follow these two steps. If I like to operate or the operands in a plot, this is something that will be set a lot. I'm probably in discussion as well as lecture. And the process for this is here. We see a college version. We're going to evaluate the operator. This case is just a addition. Nothing particularly complex. The next thing is the operand. We're going to add six and multiplication of four and six. We have to figure out what this is before we can actually do the top level addition. To figure out what this value is, we have to repeat the steps. The value of the operator, the value of the operand, this case it's six, so we just get six. And we repeat the process. We have to operate the operand and the operand. Now for this of expression, more four and six, we figured out the first two steps. We've added, we figured out what the operator is, we figured out what the operands. We can now do this final step of applying things. We can say multiplication four times six, we've got 24. We'll go up this tree structure. Because it's branching out. Then we'll say six plus 30. Now to figure out the top level, we have to go through this again. And so this is how computers actually going about solving these, like you give it an instruction and it says, all right, let's compute this value. And this is a process that it's going through. It says, first, let's look at the uppermost level. All right, what are we looking at? A college version. All right, let's look at the operator. Let's look at the operands. Let's go through this structure and figure out all the possible values. And we kind of result ultimately what we're trying to do. There's whole things called an expression tree, where we have each of the things being the expressions. And they break into sub expressions. And each of these evaluates a pretty good value. Are there any questions about this? Cool. We're going to do another demo. Thank you. Okay, so a couple of concepts in this course are functions, values, objects, interpreters and data. So you've seen the interpreter, that's the type on our interpreter. We can type in things, evaluate things. I mentioned functions like add and mole, values are like numbers, and we'll see a little bit of objects and data. In this demo, I'm going to be using some things that we haven't taught, but the point is not to confuse you. And if we had to introduce all these concepts, we wouldn't get to a cool demo on the first day. So we want to do that. So I'm just going to kind of do some things. You don't have to understand everything. If you come back maybe later in this semester, some of these might make more sense. Okay. So one time ago, there's this author, Shakespeare. I have a file on my computer. Actually, I think I need to. Nope. I misspelled Shakespeare. All right. Cool. So what this is, is this is a text document with a bunch, or I think all of Shakespeare's writings. So we can get the particular values, so we can read the data from this file, and then we can split these into words. This is going to be common. Okay. So what is in this? We're going to look at the first 25 words. Let me see. The first play, at least in this document, and did some of my nice things. That was the first words, and it's how it's the play itself. Okay. So we can ask Python how many words are in Shakespeare. So there's 980,000 words in all of the text of Shakespeare. And for me to do this manually is to take a long time, but Python did this pretty quick. So this is pretty impressive, but let's actually take closer look. So let's ask, okay, how many of these words to Shakespeare write are actually the word that. So it turns out 23,000 of every word that Shakespeare wrote is just the word that. So that's about like, five, two percent. Something like that. Another thing we can look at is if you notice in the first line, we see a bunch of commas. So because of the way I split this, commas are also considered words. So let's actually look at how many commas there are. So it's actually 81,000 commas just in Shakespeare. So let's tell many words are. We can figure out exactly what percentage it is by dividing this by how many words there are. We get about 8 percent of Shakespeare's just commas. Another thing we do is say, okay, there's a lot of repeats clearly there's a lot of buzz, but maybe we're only interested in looking at the particular unique words. So the way we can do that is we can say, alright, I only want the unique words from Shakespeare. And now we can check, okay, is that in the words that Shakespeare has? Yeah, so it is. Alright, how many words unique words does Shakespeare use? Okay, they have 33,000 unique words in Shakespeare. That's a lot. Another thing we can do is we can do some sort of string manipulation. So here, if I put this thing in quotes, this is way Python says, alright, we're just going to type this sort of string of characters and like the word. Another thing we can do is we can actually reverse words, so now it's word. Oh, that's interesting. John word are both actually words. So maybe we can look in Shakespeare, which words are also inside of their reverse. So the way we do that is we're going to look over all the words. You don't have to understand what I'm doing right here. Yeah, it's okay, I guess that's a good point. We're going to clarify the goal of this. The goal is to kind of show that Shakespeare has a lot of words. And the power of the computer is that allows us to sort of go through things automatically in order to see a lot of analysis and sort of data that would be really painful to do manually. Computers do this almost instantly and basically instantly. Well, if we were to do this manually, you'd take a long time. And so we can leverage the power of computers to sort of do this analysis on data, which was the other topic in this course. We've also seen sets, which are actually objects. And you can manipulate these. You'll kind of cover each of these concepts that I mentioned a little bit before more in depth throughout the course. Okay. So here I'm looking at all the words that are also the reverse of the words. So this is going to be Alan Grimm's, I guess. Okay, so we see all of the Alan Grimm's and Shakespeare, which are length greater than four or these ones. The writer is also a writer, level is level. I don't think we knew as we can look in Shakespeare. Maybe only care about if the word is actually also in the words. So here we're looking at all the words of length four that when you take the word, you reverse it. It's also in Shakespeare. So let's see. There's. I don't know if these are words. Not quite. Okay. Gums and mug. Oh, smell. Oh no, these are words. Okay. Move in pool. Yes. Okay. This is why I guess I'm going to put computer science later. Okay. We can also look at length five. Okay. So we have some more. We can look at length six. All right. There's still some more. Are there seven? So there's no more. Are there any more greater than seven? Okay. So we're kind of in our options. And the reason for this is Shakespeare didn't use all of the words of English or History. We can also actually load in. Let's see. I need to figure out the document. So on my computer, I have a file. You don't have to understand this. Okay. World. Nice. Nope. Words equals worlds. Okay. So now I've loaded in the dictionary of all of the words on my computer. I listed this one dictionary. So now, we look at the length of words. There's now 102,000. So originally we had, I think, 30,000. So we've increased the number of words by a lot. So we can do things like, okay, what is the longest word in this list of words or a set of words? We can take all the words. We can say, all right. What I care about is the length of these. Okay. So this is the longest word in the dictionary. I'm not going to try to pronounce that. We can also look alphabetically. You can say, okay, what's the last word in the dictionary alphabetically? Let me get it toads. All right. Let's see. What else can we do? We can go back to the original thing we had. We're saying sort of all the words, which also have reverses in it, which are at length six. So we see there's a little bit more words. And then we can look again. Are there anyone's greater than six? We actually have more of these. So stressed and de-sured dessert. Oh, damn. Um. Yeah. Okay. So we can actually, for example, we could say, okay, what is the largest word such that? Um. So we're looking at the longest word in this section in the set of words such that the reverses in it. And we get stressed and dessert. Cool. Yeah. Okay. So this is kind of all I have for this. Are there any other things you guys would be interested in looking at what we could do in this sort of data set? Maybe like looking up words that are, I don't know, are there any ideas? Yeah. How many words are there? How many words are with A? Okay. So we could take how many words if the first letter is A. So 4,600 to 26. And then I think. Yeah. Yeah. So some of these, let's say. Let's say this, except now we're going to look for. Okay. So 6000 words ignoring capitalization start with A. Any other guess? Yeah. So we only care about. So if there's a word like stress, you know, care about the inverse of it. Yeah. So the only thing that you can do that is back in this one. Not this one. This one. So another thing we can say is. I'm sure people who want this too. Oh, yes. Thank you. He asked. Is there any way we could exclude the reverse of the word? So we got stressed, but maybe we don't want desserts as well. Maybe we want desserts, but not stressed. So we don't get the word. So the way you can do that is we can say. And. We only care about the one that is actually smaller alphabetically. So we get two of them. Cool. So this actually excluded polynomials. We can actually say less than or equal if we care about polynomials. Cool. Because deified is also the reverse. Yeah. I'm interested in what are the words that started the capital A, which are the lower case A. It's might a lucid A, but it's not a lower case A. It's might a lucid A, but it's not a lower case A. It's not a lower case A. It's might a lucid A, but it's not a lower case A. It's might a lucid A something. Oh. That's a lot. Oh, so the reason why is. Let's look at. So some of these words like. Arctic also have the capitalization. So when we lower case them, we don't care about the ones that were also deprecated. Any other ideas? Yeah. Most number of values. Okay. So we can say. We're going to max over the words. You don't need to know what this means. I'm going to say. But you will soon. You'll be able to understand all of this. Yes. And we want to. Some of. One. Or W. And. X. If. Uh. Let's see. If. W. And. A. I owe you. So this is the word that has the most value. So you're talking about evolutionary. Yeah. Like the word that has the most. Uh, eating up like a single letter. Most repeating single letter. Um. So we can say. We want the maximum word where the keys equal to. Well, okay. So we can do it with a specific vowel. So if I said which one has the most ease. We get teleconference. You could say. Um, X, which one has the most X's? X ons. Not quite sure how you do with all of the letters though. I can see you have to have a good thing. Yeah. You have to kind of go through all the letters and then get the maximum of all of those. So we'd have to sit here and type a long string with the whole alphabet. We could do it, but it'll take a while. Yeah. So. I know. Say it. Yeah. The whole alphabet. We could do it, but it'll take a while. Yeah. We could do it. But it'll take a while. Yeah. So. The. I know. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Oh, yeah. He's saying like. Um. He's saying to the subtract the set of unique letters from the length of the word. Um, because then you'll have a, but like, I think the dot version. Right. So like if you have two letters that both repeat a lot, you want to say we get the one word with the most repeats of the same letter. Right. Like, okay. Basically, the probably isn't easy way to do this, but we don't know at the top of our head. But I think that approach would. I mean, yeah could say. Oh, my god. Okay, so I'm iterating over all the letters and I'm saying, Well, I don't need this. Oh, generate. Oh, okay. I see. Do. And has the most A's, I guess. Wait, that's like not that many A's. What's it? I mean, maybe it's a lot of A's. Yeah, I guess I can't say it's a lot of A's. Yeah. I'm not very good at regular expressions. That's a good thing. Okay, cool. I can hold that back there. Cool. So I guess the purpose is going to show you some neat things you can do in Python. You can actually download the Shakespeare text. It's in the textbook. I think it's one of the first links. If you go to the 1.1 chapter, if you want to mess around with yourself. I'm just going to show you the neat things you can do in Python. We're going to be moving on to some other kind of building up and maybe by the end of the semester. You kind of understand all the specific things that we've done and how you might approach these for yourself. Watch our way tomorrow. Thank you all for coming. We'll be up here if you have any questions. Wow.",
