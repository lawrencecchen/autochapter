Now sometimes that was some social implications thing where we talked about the impact of computing. I mean, as we were before, I was like, you're age at the time.

Passage: Now poverty is one of those things that is surprisingly hard to quantify which is the first real issue for governments that are trying to address this issue. Incomes are the most used metric, and almost every statistic you have likely heard on the issue will say something like these people live on less than 2 dollars a day, and for what itâ€™s worth we have done exactly the same thing already in this video. But there are two problems with this, the first is that some people can be extremely comfortable with not much income. Some retirees would be a good example of this.
