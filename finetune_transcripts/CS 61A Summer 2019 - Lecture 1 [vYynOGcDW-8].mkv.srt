1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
All right, okay, is this projecting at all?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Can everyone hear me?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,720
Give me the back.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,080
We get, awesome.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,520
All right, so welcome everyone to the first lecture

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,720
of CS61A.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah!

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,560
APPLAUSE

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,880
Wow, I'm so glad that got a response.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,320
So this is, I'm super glad to see this lecture in so full.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,480
So let's just go ahead and jump in to the first lecture.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,160
Before we talk about anything relating to computer science,

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,560
first we're going to talk about 6.1A as a class,

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,840
starting with the 6.1A community.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,920
So first of all, hi, my name's Chris.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,960
I'm going to be one of your instructors.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,480
My pronouns are they, them.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,720
And I've been teaching 6.1A for a while.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,320
I've been a TA for five semesters involved a bit before that.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,720
And this is my first time as an instructor for this course.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,200
So I'm really excited.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,040
Some might interest within computer science

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,400
our computational biology and programming languages.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,200
So if you want to talk about that or really anything

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,560
in the course, you can feel free to reach out.

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,120
I'm going to go ahead and pass around this mic.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,160
There's going to be a little bit of like,

28
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,760
some noise is going on.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,920
Let's see.

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,880
Let's see.

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,400
Yeah.

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,600
My name's Debbie.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
This is, I'll be one of your other lecturers in the summer.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,440
This is my eight time teaching the course.

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,760
So my first time lecture, in terms of computer science,

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,440
my interest in computer security

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,640
and a demo some research in agritorial and out.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,120
So if you find yourself interested in that later

39
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,240
on the course, which we'll try to talk to me,

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,800
also this is a really difficult course.

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,120
So we're all here to talk to you about anything

42
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
if you've ever needed.

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,880
So free email on us, I think that's it.

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,120
I'll be one of the other three instructors.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,760
My research interests are kind of probably

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,080
language design, as well as the applications

47
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,320
to CS education in particular.

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,800
This is also taught it for a fair amount.

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,760
Excited to be.

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Cool.

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,120
All right, so I'll take this back.

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,040
So if you ever want to contact us,

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,560
you should email us at CS61A plus SU19 at Berkeley.edu.

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,720
If you email us there, you'll be able to,

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,960
all three of us will see that.

56
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,280
So that's the best way to contact us.

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
You can also reach out to us individually

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,120
if you have something pertaining to one of us

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,000
as individuals, but this is the email you should be

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
looking at for the most part.

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,880
So we're here in Struck.

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,400
We're also here coming in.

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,520
There's a lot of seats on this side.

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,720
So it's so pretty to go in on the other entry.

65
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
And those are like seats in experts.

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,640
So maybe if you're in the middle area,

67
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,040
we could like switch together a little bit,

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,600
really just coming in.

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,960
Yeah, there's a seat next to you,

70
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
and you can move to the center.

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,400
Let's do that so people coming in can do that.

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,320
Awesome.

73
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,760
I'll give like a minute for the noise to settle here.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,240
All right, so you've met us.

75
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,880
We're going to be your instructors,

76
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,600
but there's just three of us,

77
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,560
and there's like 400 plus a view in this room.

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,400
So there's no way we can do all this by ourselves,

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,960
which is why we have a wonderful team of TAs,

80
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,240
as well as tutors.

81
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,360
So TAs are responsible for running lab and discussion sections.

82
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,760
You'll see them in office hours.

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,520
Tutors are responsible for running smaller group tutoring

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,000
sections, which we'll talk about a little bit later.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,720
But both TAs and tutors are going to be the people you're

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,080
going to be interacting with most often throughout the course.

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,000
So with that in mind, we have a bunch of them

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,760
up here on stage, so I'm going to go ahead

89
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,200
and try to pass down the mic when you get it.

90
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,400
If you can just give your name, your role.

91
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you can come down here

92
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,880
and pass it down, yeah.

93
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,320
So I have like two cables tethering me down.

94
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,680
It's a lot of fun.

95
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,960
OK, I want to make TAs an Albert.

96
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,240
I want to be part of the new grading,

97
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,960
so I'll give you why as TAs, and then I'll also be doing

98
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,920
a little bit of the T, that music's on the side,

99
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,280
so maybe this is not a whole domain of TAs,

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,800
but I've got to give you some money on my music,

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
so it's an opportunity to talk about that,

102
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,280
to give you the objective.

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,840
Hello, I'm Richard.

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
I took six to make last summer.

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm going to be a TAs this summer.

106
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm really excited to be teaching about it, so.

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,440
And while I'm running on one of the other materials,

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,000
and I do content for the projects.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,880
Hello, my name is Jason.

110
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,960
I'm going to be TAs this summer,

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
and you can feel free to come here in one second.

112
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,200
Hi, I'm Olivia, I'm a TAs, and I think

113
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,520
we're just a little bit more in.

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm also TAs, and I'm going to be working

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,720
on the online content itself.

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,080
Welcome.

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,240
Hi, I'm Edo, and I'm a TAs.

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Hi, I'm Michelle, and welcome with Olivia,

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
and I'm a little bit of just six.

120
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Hi, I'm Edo, and I'm TAs, and I'm TAs, and I'm TAs.

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Hi, I'm Jenny, first, and I'm from the classical century.

122
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Woo!

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Woo!

124
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Thank you.

125
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Thank you.

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,840
Thank you.

127
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,800
All right, y'all can feel free to add back a little bit.

128
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:46,640
All right, okay, so again, these tutors and TAs

129
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,920
are going to be the people you're going to be

130
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,360
interacting with the most throughout the semester.

131
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,320
So once you start going to lab and discussion,

132
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,280
these are the people that you should be sure to get to know,

133
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,760
and they'll be the best people to handle

134
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,800
most of your questions and concerns in this course.

135
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,280
In addition to TAs and tutors, we also have a very, very

136
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,160
large group of academic interns.

137
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Academic interns are students who usually recently

138
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,960
took the class, and they'll be helping out in your lab

139
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,240
and office hour sections to give you some help with the assignments.

140
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,440
This is like a very small subset of the people we'll have

141
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,360
helping out as AI's over the summer, so you'll

142
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,760
be seeing a lot of those as well.

143
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,440
And then, in addition to TAs, tutors, instructors,

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,880
and academic interns, we have the most important people

145
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,040
in this course, all of you.

146
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Yeah.

147
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,000
APPLAUSE

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Very much not used to all this applause, but I don't know.

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
Yeah, it comes with a job, I guess.

150
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
So yeah, over the summer, this is by far the largest group

151
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
of students we've ever had for summer course,

152
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,280
across the in-person 61A and online 6.1A sections.

153
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,240
We have over 650 people enrolled in this course.

154
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,400
And all of us are really, really excited

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,240
to be able to work with all of you and put on a great class

156
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,840
semester.

157
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,040
Really excited to be able to talk to you and work

158
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,800
with you through all of this.

159
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,240
So with that, let's start talking about 6.1A in particular.

160
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,560
So 6.1A is a class in the computer science department.

161
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,680
For many of you, it might be your first computer science class.

162
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,560
So what is computer science?

163
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,280
Computer science is a very broad field.

164
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,160
But in general, computer science is the study

165
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,240
of different problems that can be solved using computation.

166
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,600
So all computation means is that you do some series of steps.

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,440
Maybe you're doing some math or just following some instructions

168
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,400
to be able to get some result.

169
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,680
This doesn't even need to be done with computers.

170
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,080
In fact, in the early days, if you just

171
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,120
had someone write a bunch of math,

172
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,360
you might even call them computers.

173
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,480
But more specifically, computer science

174
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,560
is how do you take these problems and solve the different approaches

175
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
for being able to solve these problems?

176
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
So there are a bunch of different ways

177
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,280
you can approach different problems.

178
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,400
A bunch of different ways you can solve them with computation.

179
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,960
And computer science talks about some

180
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,560
of those different approaches.

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,680
In particular, we are interested in the techniques

182
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,920
that lead to the most effective solutions.

183
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,840
So of course, some solutions will take more time or require

184
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,360
more resources than others.

185
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,040
So we're interested in the solutions

186
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,560
that are going to be the most effective.

187
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,800
One other thing to note is that not all problems

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,280
can be solved effectively through computation.

189
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,720
For example, a lot of problems out there

190
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,880
will require you to actually, I don't know, interact with people.

191
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,080
And those tasks aren't very easily solved

192
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,360
by just a list of steps you can blindly follow.

193
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,200
So it's important to note that computer science

194
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,440
doesn't tell you how to solve every problem.

195
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
But there's a great variety of problems

196
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,280
that it can solve.

197
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,720
And we're interested in effective solutions

198
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,080
for those problems.

199
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,240
So what are some of these different problems that you can solve?

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,040
So there's systems like operating systems,

201
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,680
compilers, artificial intelligence, graphics,

202
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,640
so on and so forth.

203
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,880
There's a big long list.

204
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
These are just a subset of the interests

205
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,080
that people at Berkeley have as their research interests.

206
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,400
But just about any of these topics,

207
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,080
if you're interested in, you can ultimately

208
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,720
take a class in at Berkeley or elsewhere.

209
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,160
By the way, if you're sitting in the back,

210
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,800
we still do have quite a few seats on this side of the room

211
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,720
if you want to move over and not clog up the rows.

212
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,800
So, are these ways probably exiting

213
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
and then going through the other entry?

214
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
There's another door on this side,

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,040
so if you exit the ground.

216
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Of course.

217
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
So that's computer science.

218
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
What is 61A in particular about?

219
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,160
Well, it's about managing complexity.

220
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,840
So a lot of these problems can have really

221
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,160
complicated and large solutions.

222
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,680
And one important skill to be able to have

223
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,760
is how to take these solutions and express them

224
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,200
in a really simple and effective way.

225
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,280
One of the ways we teach this in this course

226
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,840
is through mastering abstraction.

227
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,080
So what abstraction means is for most things you run across,

228
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,080
you don't need to know exactly how they work.

229
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,200
You can take some of the complicated details

230
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,960
and, well, abstract them away.

231
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,160
So for example, when you're interacting with other people,

232
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
when you see human being, you don't see them

233
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,600
as a collection of cells or a bunch of chemical processes

234
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,080
happening, you interact with them as humans.

235
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,100
So you abstract away all those chemical and biological

236
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,240
processes and view them as a human.

237
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,640
With programs, instead of looking at the very minute details

238
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,800
of what's going on, we'll see different ways

239
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
to group them and abstract them.

240
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,720
One of those ways is by exposing you to different programming

241
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
paradigms.

242
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,520
So programming paradigms are just different ways

243
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,320
to approach writing programs.

244
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,000
And a lot of these have very general abstract differences.

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,240
So across this course, we'll be exposing you

246
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,320
to imperative, declarative, functional,

247
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,000
several different types of programming.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,680
And these are different ways that you can organize your program

249
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,680
and help manage its complexity.

250
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,760
Of course, 61A, again, is many of your first computer science

251
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,240
classes, so we also hope for it to serve

252
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,880
as an introduction to program.

253
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,160
So we'll hope that we can give you

254
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,440
a pretty full understanding of Python fundamentals.

255
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,720
After you go through this course, you

256
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,120
should be able to do a lot in Python.

257
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
We also take a lot of smaller ideas

258
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,440
that will teach in lecture and discussion in lab

259
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,040
and combine those into larger projects, which

260
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,960
is an important skill to be able to have

261
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,640
when you're in the real world, because most of what you're

262
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,760
going to be doing is large projects.

263
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,440
And finally, we'll talk a little bit

264
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,960
about how computers interpret programming languages.

265
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,640
So when you write code, how does your computer actually

266
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,240
take that code and how is it able to run it?

267
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
In the beginning of the course, we'll

268
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,000
talk about this more mechanically.

269
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,720
So we'll have you actually do some of the interpretation

270
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,520
yourself.

271
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,000
But later in the course, we'll talk about how computers

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,280
can interpret programming languages automatically.

273
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,800
And finally, this is a challenging course

274
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,920
that will demand a lot for me.

275
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,840
The pace of this course is very fast.

276
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,320
There's going to be a lot of assignments.

277
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,360
However, if you do choose to stick with this class,

278
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,320
we have a lot of resources available,

279
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
and we do really want you to succeed.

280
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,760
So please don't understand the pace and difficulty

281
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,320
of this class, but also understand

282
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,720
that there's a lot of things available for you

283
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,800
if you want to stick with this class.

284
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,000
That being said, this class isn't the right first programming

285
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
or computer science class for everyone.

286
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
And with that in mind, there are a couple of alternatives

287
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,480
to CS61A that you might want to keep in mind.

288
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,280
So the first one is CS10, called the beauty and joy

289
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,240
of computing.

290
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,360
CS10 is designed for students who do not have prior experience.

291
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,080
So even though in 61A, we try to make the course such

292
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
that you can still succeed.

293
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,040
Even if you don't have prior programming experience,

294
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,480
I didn't have prior programming experience

295
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,120
when I took the course, for example.

296
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,760
However, CS10 is specifically designed

297
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,200
for students without prior experience.

298
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,560
So for some students, this is a better fit for your first class.

299
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,520
This is an introduction to some of the fundamentals

300
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,080
of computer science.

301
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,560
It does go over some Python, although some of the class

302
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,080
is also in a language called snap, which

303
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,920
is more of a visual language.

304
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,560
But after going through CS10, you'll

305
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,680
know a lot of the concepts and Python fundamentals

306
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,440
that you'll need for 61A.

307
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,360
Right now, it has a shortest waitlist.

308
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,720
And over the summer, it has been taught by Matthew and Monty.

309
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,840
So you can see more info at cs10.org.

310
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,880
There's also data eight, which is the foundations of data science.

311
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,400
So data goes over the fundamentals of computing

312
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,640
of statistical inference and some a little bit

313
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,760
of machine learning applied to real world data sets.

314
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
So the purpose of data eight is a little bit different

315
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,480
than CS61A.

316
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,680
CS61A is a class about computer science.

317
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,200
Data eight is a class about data science,

318
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,080
which is a little bit different because it's more concerned

319
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,160
with how you process data, but there is still

320
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,080
quite a bit of overlap.

321
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,520
It does feature more statistics than computer science.

322
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,520
However, the programming isn't 61A,

323
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,640
so it is a good exposure to Python if you want to take that

324
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,920
before 61A.

325
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,920
If you want to enroll, it's listed as CSC8,

326
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,440
although it's referred to as data eight.

327
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,280
It has a little bit of a larger waitlist,

328
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,000
but it is being taught over the summer by Natalia and Francie.

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,760
It's actually the lecture right before this one.

330
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,720
So you'll probably run to them as they're exiting the hall.

331
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,280
All right.

332
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,120
So more info on data eight.org.

333
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,200
So I'm going to go ahead and hand it off to Tiffany

334
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,240
to talk a little bit about the course logistics,

335
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,680
again, pardon me, as there's a little bit of noise here.

336
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,160
So we're trying to get screencasts for most of these lectures,

337
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,440
which means we need both the mic to project

338
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,480
and another mic to record.

339
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,520
So it's a little bit of technical setup.

340
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,480
We'll talk a bit about that in a minute.

341
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,520
So I'm going to talk a bit about course format

342
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,880
and concretely just, so first off,

343
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,240
this course has a lot of different components.

344
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,720
I'll just do the thing right now.

345
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,600
There's a lecture that'll be every Monday

346
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,640
through Thursday at 11 a.m. in this room.

347
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,120
Lecture is where you're going to be exposed

348
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,080
to course material for the first time.

349
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,160
So we strongly encourage you to come in person.

350
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
So you see the lecture before your discussion,

351
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
because generally, although your change

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,760
is very kind, it will be we need discussions most effective

353
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,720
if you've seen the relevant lecture beforehand.

354
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,960
There's also a lab, discussion and office analysis.

355
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,640
The reason that these are all labeled

356
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,000
the most important part of the course

357
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,080
is because it really depends on the student

358
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,120
and we encourage you to both.

359
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
You should really complete all of them,

360
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,520
and you'll see that probably one of them

361
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,400
will be the most effective for your learning.

362
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,200
The lab is the place where you'll usually,

363
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,680
after lecture before discussion,

364
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,120
you're going to actually interact with your machine

365
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,280
to do some programming in the soda labs.

366
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,240
This is where you'll get to interact with a lot of concepts

367
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,280
for the first time in discussion.

368
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,800
You're going to actually be working on pen and paper.

369
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,600
And you may be wondering, why do we do that?

370
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,200
This is because this course is actually quite theoretical.

371
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,240
This isn't a programming course.

372
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
You will learn programming over the course of the course,

373
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,120
but that was not meant to be like a hot rhyme.

374
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
That isn't the focus.

375
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,880
The focus is giving you a foundation and computer science.

376
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
And that's why discussion where you go over questions

377
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,360
with a pen and paper is a really fundamental part of the course

378
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,880
and happens after a lab once you've got your fundamentals down.

379
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,600
All this hours are where you can drop by to ask any questions.

380
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,920
Oftentimes, we'll come with a side of questions

381
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,000
because the assignments are very challenging.

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
This is where you'll interact with a lot of the active

383
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
in the interns as well.

384
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,680
And then, we also have an online textbook.

385
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,320
Some students read this textbook,

386
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,640
and the chapter is associated.

387
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,960
You'll feed on the website.

388
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,760
Every lecture has associated text and chapters.

389
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,800
Some students read this before lecture.

390
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,720
Some students read this after lecture.

391
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,920
Some students don't read this textbook at all.

392
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,760
I don't know about the key here, how much of the text works.

393
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,720
But we highly encourage you for a use of first

394
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
D to read the text book and see what you're

395
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,800
trying to help for.

396
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,840
Personally, a lot of the text books.

397
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,800
And I think, because now it's going to read the text book,

398
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,600
because it's not a color.

399
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm not trying to say both are normal and acceptable.

400
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,960
But ultimately, it just depends on what your learning style is.

401
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,800
So try it out and see what works for you.

402
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,960
And there's also weekly homework assignments

403
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,120
for big program projects, a midterm and a final.

404
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,240
And the reason we're listing all this

405
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
is to say, it will be very demanding.

406
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,520
And this is what you can expect.

407
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,480
But there also will be a lot of support along the way.

408
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,880
Any questions?

409
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,440
Yeah, in the front.

410
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,080
So the program is going to be able to program the project

411
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,440
all the time.

412
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,920
Yes.

413
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,960
Holly, you put it in the program you project.

414
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,240
You wouldn't believe the point is.

415
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,320
But you're like, yeah, so there are four projects.

416
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,000
There are a lot of means about them online.

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,640
And soon, you'll be able to relate to those movies.

418
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,280
So in terms of the first week, you just logistics.

419
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,560
Lab will start in Wednesday.

420
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,360
So even if you have a Monday or Tuesday

421
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,440
lab not happening this week, because that's just set up.

422
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Do the lab on your own.

423
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,960
Stop it all.

424
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,720
The stars if you need help, but set up.

425
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,560
Just one quick announcement about Lab Zero.

426
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,240
On Piazza, some of you were mentioning

427
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,560
that you were running into some issues with Lab Zero.

428
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,400
I think we found that some students running in Map OS

429
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,120
are able to run Lab Zero.

430
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,880
So we're working on fixing that.

431
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,800
So this is not working for you.

432
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,360
We'll let you know when you can read download it,

433
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
and it should be fixed.

434
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,920
This is an example of debugging on the spot.

435
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,360
There'll be a left-shandered bug you see.

436
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,760
But yeah, we'll have a fix up shortly,

437
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,240
and you should keep an eye on Piazza.

438
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,640
In terms of discussion, discussions start on Tuesday.

439
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,200
And we highly encourage you to attend the discussion

440
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,040
of matches your lab.

441
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,440
You can see on the base in your discussion number,

442
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
you can see whether they've mapped your lab.

443
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
They should have the same pattern.

444
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,120
The reason for this is so that you see the same Pia,

445
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,200
and they get to know you, and they'll

446
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
be able to help you much more effectively.

447
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
It's also better organizationally for hours.

448
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,080
And finally, office hours will also start on Tuesday.

449
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,640
There are no office hours today.

450
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
OK, so in terms of attendance,

451
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,080
we do not select luxury tenants at all.

452
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,120
But as I said, you highly encourage you to attend.

453
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,320
This is our first time trying to webcast the summer session.

454
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
So we'll try to make it as involved as you can,

455
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,160
but there are no promises around that.

456
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,840
This is kind of an experience.

457
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,760
So you can come in person without quality bets.

458
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,560
And historically, if you fall behind in terms of lecture,

459
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,400
which is what often happens with students don't come to lecture,

460
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,440
the other parts of the course is snowball

461
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,040
and become a lot more difficult.

462
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,960
So it really encourage you to come with your tenant.

463
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,320
Discussion and lab attendance aren't tracked,

464
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
and we're going to talk about what that counts for in a bit.

465
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
It doesn't directly count for your grades,

466
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,400
but it counts for something called participation points.

467
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,520
And then finally, all your assignments, labs,

468
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,520
home rates, projects can be submitted remotely.

469
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
So if you happen to be out of Berkeley for some reason,

470
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
or you have an emergency, as long as you look computer on you,

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,800
you should be fine.

472
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,360
OK, so as you mentioned earlier, with some of your tutors,

473
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,640
we also offer a small room tutoring section,

474
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,560
which are led by the staff that we saw earlier.

475
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,760
Local structures are around four of these people,

476
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,680
and it's just to be a more intimate environment

477
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,880
to review the material.

478
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,960
But these are from the optional, and there

479
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,600
are limited number of spots.

480
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,520
So around the end of this week, we'll have sign-ups.

481
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,360
And to make it more clear, the purpose of these sections

482
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,440
are, if in discussion, you feel like you

483
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,280
aren't getting enough review, and you would like more practice,

484
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,320
you can sign up for one of these tutoring sections,

485
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,160
you'll get more practice with supplemental material,

486
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,400
and a small environment, so maybe you can ask more questions

487
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,280
and feel more comfortable.

488
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,880
Those sign-ups will be up on this.

489
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,240
And in this week, I'm Piazza.

490
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,280
Also, we have something called conceptual office hours.

491
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,640
So I do think it all upstairs is a good session

492
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,920
in my training work.

493
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,760
But unfortunately, you're on a side of usually

494
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,520
that cloned with just to make a sign-up question

495
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,480
and debugging help, which is also useful,

496
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
but usually doesn't get to the core of the material,

497
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,560
the key constants that may test on your exams,

498
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,720
for example.

499
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,920
So conceptual office hours are a place that

500
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,680
are specifically reserved for no assignment help

501
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,560
and only conceptual questions.

502
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,040
So these will be out into the calendar scene,

503
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,280
and you can expect to go there for that type of help.

504
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,000
So girl is such a piece.

505
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,440
Historically, in this course, a combination

506
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,040
is because people can continue collecting every single day

507
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,000
and it's kind of a great decade.

508
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,440
It was student falls behind to whatever reason.

509
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,320
There's a great opportunity to catch

510
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,120
back up on materials that just pass, right?

511
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,480
Because we just keep going with new content.

512
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,080
Real sections are kind of meant to go this gap

513
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,120
because they'll be once a week.

514
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,720
They go from zero to a hundred of that little material

515
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,800
to a scaffolding worksheet.

516
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,960
Essentially, with a formatting, they'll go to this room

517
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
with a bunch of mixed units,

518
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
working to get some on the view on depth

519
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,200
as this is a big topic.

520
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
So it's doing it from cheering sections

521
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,600
and that you don't sign up.

522
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,720
They're going to be dropping.

523
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,680
You can go to one, you can go to all of them.

524
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,400
And at the bill section, you'll be in groups

525
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,920
and work through this gap with a worksheet

526
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,560
and hopefully by the end,

527
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,360
feel much more comfortable with those topics

528
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,800
that you might have missed earlier in the week.

529
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,240
Does that make sense to be ready?

530
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,920
Or any questions that I think I went through so far?

531
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,280
Yeah, that's fine.

532
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,800
Is the left task going to be real?

533
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,960
So I'm not going to go to the court as opposed to that.

534
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,520
For a court and a post it, Alex and Chris know more about it.

535
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,760
Yeah, so we're like, the reason we have so many microphones

536
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
is because we're recording it right now.

537
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,680
But to note, there's no guarantees on one

538
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,080
that screencast will go up.

539
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,640
It might be that evening, it might be a day or two later.

540
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,480
So that's, it's meant to help you review the lectures

541
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,640
if you missed something in live lecture,

542
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,840
but it's not meant to be a consistent replacement

543
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,680
for live lecture.

544
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,000
Cool.

545
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,440
Any other questions?

546
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
Yeah.

547
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,360
What answer?

548
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,200
Yeah.

549
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,040
We're going to be every Friday at 11 a.m.

550
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
So we have lecture, money,

551
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,520
you're freezing, real protection, but Friday, I think

552
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,000
it's still in the book or room,

553
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,200
but we'll have those details on the website too.

554
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,320
It won't start this week.

555
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,280
It will start like in the future.

556
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,360
Yeah, don't we know the real section this week?

557
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,600
They start second week.

558
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,240
Okay.

559
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,280
Are you missing at home?

560
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,120
Yes.

561
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
In the front.

562
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,960
Oh.

563
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,160
I mean,

564
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,800
it's going to look more and more carefully

565
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,280
to take the stage around it,

566
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,480
but more more more more.

567
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,000
They may change right.

568
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,400
Oh, yes, it turns from the fire, of course,

569
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,120
to the hands,

570
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,920
but I don't know if it's the one hand to the one

571
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,760
that won't be done at 18.

572
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,600
Yeah.

573
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,440
So the question was,

574
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,400
do the homework to change?

575
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,040
So the function has to be where it is.

576
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,840
We also do know if the project will change

577
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
by the way, doesn't look enough.

578
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,880
The homework will be so much different

579
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,520
because we're going in a different case,

580
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,840
the numbers will map,

581
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,800
but quite a few of the problems are shared.

582
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,160
I hope this has been getting at like,

583
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,760
ask your friends to introduce them up to you,

584
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,600
do you think?

585
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
You not do that.

586
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,760
Those are a lot of things,

587
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,040
but yeah, some of the homework problems

588
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,520
are similar to the past and that.

589
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,080
All right.

590
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,440
There's one more question.

591
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,280
Yeah.

592
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,960
So the realizations are 11 a.m. on Friday, two, what time?

593
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
11 1 p.m. on Friday.

594
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,800
Yeah.

595
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,640
Okay.

596
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,200
And we have more details up on Kiazza

597
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
once you have the room book

598
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,040
and one deception that for half of it.

599
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,520
Yeah.

600
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,280
Oh, can we come like half way?

601
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,880
Yeah.

602
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,480
So you're,

603
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,760
you're free to come half way, no one will stop you.

604
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,480
But it might, because we try to keep the group's pace,

605
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,920
it'll be a little bit harder,

606
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,640
possibly, but you're free to come,

607
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,440
just have that in mind that it'll be a little bit more

608
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,480
difficult to keep up and become half way.

609
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Cool.

610
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,920
So let's go a little bit into disagreeing breakdown.

611
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,160
This is a graph of how your points are distributed.

612
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,440
There's more details on the website.

613
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,440
I don't want to get to it in the new shazits.

614
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
Just to note, 140 of your points are from the exams,

615
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,800
which we'll talk about in a bit,

616
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,760
and 150 of your points within the budget.

617
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,720
So it was a really the both of your points.

618
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,920
So it made you put the decision points earlier

619
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,960
from discussion and lab attendance,

620
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,160
participation points as you would have noticed

621
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,840
in that three graph, not here.

622
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,400
The reason for that is because they don't

623
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,760
explicitly count towards your final grade.

624
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,360
If you don't want to participate,

625
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,040
you could not participate in any lab discussion.

626
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,280
However, we don't really encourage that.

627
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,760
So if you're putting in effort,

628
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
if you go to every lab and every discussion,

629
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,320
if you happen to do below 50% of your exam,

630
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,040
your attendance and your participation points

631
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,000
will help you get closer to 50%.

632
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,840
So if you do above 50%, it won't help you at all.

633
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,640
If you do below 50%, it'll help you at closer.

634
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,120
The specific or mill we use for toppling this

635
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,440
is on the website, you can like 10,000 numbers

636
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,040
see the precise number of discussions

637
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
you want to go to, but ultimately,

638
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,040
I encourage you to just go to your discussions and labs.

639
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,760
The point of this is to give the credit

640
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,480
the people who are really trying the best in the course.

641
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,520
And for some reason, don't go to the exam,

642
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,440
but you will let everything out.

643
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
That'll make sense.

644
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,560
Any questions?

645
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Does that make this patient?

646
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,400
Yeah.

647
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,200
Can you tell me if you're going to the school

648
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,520
or are you especially going to the lab

649
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,840
that we are involved in?

650
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,800
Yeah, you can get the patient credit going

651
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,040
to a different section, but for the first two weeks,

652
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,240
please try to put this section here in Golden,

653
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,000
just because we'll all be quite happy.

654
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,520
To be clear, the discussion section here in Golden

655
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,280
and the lab section that matches with that discussion section.

656
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,120
Yes.

657
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,200
Am I missing any?

658
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,440
Okay.

659
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,000
All right.

660
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,480
So another thing I'm reading,

661
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,920
there's going to be quite a bit of a new shift

662
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,280
for a next slide, five slides.

663
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,960
We're almost there.

664
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,640
Homer 3D is done because after.

665
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
What this means is that you don't be distressed

666
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,320
about getting the entire homework fully threatened,

667
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,000
especially some of the homework from this class

668
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,040
will be very challenging.

669
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,480
And we don't want you, that's your head.

670
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,560
If you're too bored because you can't get one or two problems.

671
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,800
Instead of how we do homework 3D is,

672
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,720
if you get the majority of the problems correct,

673
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,960
and we see some evidence of effort for the rest of the problems

674
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,960
I mean, you wrote a program, we have other metrics

675
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,480
for measuring whether you tried on our end,

676
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,120
but for your purposes, this means Google attempts

677
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,640
and all the problems getting most of them correct.

678
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,240
If you do this, you will get credit

679
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,440
for your homework assignments.

680
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,120
This means basically the point of this is knowing

681
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,680
you to be pressured to teach or look your friend's solution

682
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,520
at anything like that, because if you put in your effort,

683
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,320
keep up in the material, you should be able to get both

684
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,760
in on the homework just by trying on your problems

685
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,120
and getting most of them correct.

686
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,720
Any questions on this because I know

687
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,360
this might be able to confuse you?

688
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,840
Okay, other, yeah, in the front.

689
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,680
Or some of them are more than two lines of homework

690
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,320
so all of them come out of the network.

691
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,160
Yeah.

692
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,000
So we've got to be in the front,

693
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,320
some of the homework and a few lines of code,

694
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
only a few lines of code, how do you measure effort?

695
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,840
That's really good question.

696
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,240
So effort is definitely not writing a wall

697
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,520
and it's program possible.

698
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,000
That's not how programming works.

699
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,840
That's what it could mean.

700
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,000
We have evidence of all your methods.

701
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,960
So the reason I give you details is because this one

702
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
should be easy when you're trying to name the system

703
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,120
and that's not what we want.

704
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,560
The reason we don't be creative corrected

705
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
is trying to make it as easy and possible,

706
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,040
but just to give some transparency,

707
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,320
we have kind of our whole history of your homework.

708
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,280
We've seen when you started,

709
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,080
you see how many times you tried,

710
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,320
there's a lot of data there.

711
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,320
So we know, yeah, I hope that kind of answers the question.

712
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
But if I give you like a black threshold,

713
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,120
then you could all just, I don't know,

714
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,280
try making five submissions and then we're done with it

715
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,800
and that's not really the point.

716
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,400
I don't even know what to do with it,

717
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,240
but yeah.

718
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,600
I don't know what to do with it as you go through it

719
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,440
as well as the fact that what I don't do

720
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
are asking for asking to do it for us.

721
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Yeah.

722
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,120
Oh, okay.

723
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,960
Good question.

724
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,000
So you won't know what you're correct.

725
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,240
That's a big deal.

726
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,560
All the homework's from autofrainers,

727
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,840
so you'll know what you're correct

728
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,560
as soon as you found the correct question.

729
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,040
In the front.

730
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,320
I don't think that seeing programming is good

731
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120
to do around that first end,

732
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,160
you have to correct me as you do,

733
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,960
get out of the right answer, right?

734
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,280
Yeah, I'm correct, I'm correct.

735
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,120
I'm correct.

736
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,640
So you get a 100 and a 10.

737
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,120
If you read the about page,

738
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,880
we go more in depth into this.

739
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,560
It's kind of hard to explain in person,

740
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,600
so you should read that first

741
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,720
and then there are any questions.

742
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,040
Essentially, we'd be like to extract away

743
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,960
how the effort creating works to kind of open earlier,

744
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
but just trust that happens that the point is,

745
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,480
don't stress about getting all the problems correct,

746
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,560
but try all of them, get most of them correct.

747
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,400
All right.

748
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,640
So, you guys are seeing uncorrected and composition,

749
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,360
but you will get project partners.

750
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,240
So hopefully that lightens below in a bit.

751
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,160
Where you tell us that here,

752
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,840
and keep in mind that projects are pretty big,

753
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,080
it's the start one there, it actually posted.

754
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Please don't put them off for the last minute.

755
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,280
Labs are also bringing on confusion,

756
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,840
but you get two labs jobs.

757
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,060
So we encourage you to put in your best effort.

758
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,980
We are gonna double check something.

759
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,520
Labs are great uncorrected, is right?

760
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,360
Yeah, yeah.

761
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,680
Okay.

762
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,520
Yes.

763
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,840
So, I've got the view both correct measurements,

764
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,680
but yeah.

765
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,400
So, we encourage you to complete all the labs

766
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,240
and try to finish,

767
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,480
and there are many to be assignments

768
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,080
that you can finish in the lab fully correct.

769
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
But if you end up having an off day,

770
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,600
you get one or two, not at 100%, it's okay.

771
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,640
You get two labs job.

772
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,520
More details, you have this website.

773
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,360
Okay.

774
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,200
So also we have slip days.

775
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,960
There are a lot of ways you try to introduce

776
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,160
community in the course, one is your one 24 hour slip day.

777
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,920
So this can be used on homework and projects.

778
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,520
We have, you know, final deadline,

779
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,040
officially on the course website,

780
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,320
let's say you have some emergency situation,

781
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,680
then you can use your slip day,

782
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,240
and submit a day later,

783
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,720
and you'll still get full credit.

784
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,520
But you can only do this one for this semester.

785
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,200
One thing to note is that,

786
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,960
let's say you have a project partner,

787
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,720
you use your slip hand off,

788
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,440
and then you partner up for dance,

789
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,280
which is on project three.

790
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,240
They have a slip day, but you don't.

791
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,320
If you both submit together a day later,

792
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,840
you're gonna get the late penalty, but they won't.

793
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
So that's an important thing to note.

794
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,760
Slip days are individual,

795
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,720
they can't be shared or gifted.

796
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,080
We don't agree, so sort of great economy in this class.

797
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,920
Okay.

798
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,360
And it's finally, these are the two of your exams.

799
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,520
Please make sure that your schedules are cleared.

800
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,040
Unless you have another class

801
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,960
with a directing van conflict,

802
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,800
we cannot offer an alternate.

803
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,320
So there will be a post for,

804
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,400
if you do have a class with a direct conflict,

805
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
how you can request an alternate,

806
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,280
that information will all be on Piazza,

807
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,480
but otherwise, please note the exam times.

808
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,240
Unless you have another class,

809
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,640
we cannot make exceptions.

810
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
All right, and now, let's just talk a little bit

811
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,280
about preparing for these exams

812
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,000
that feel like I've been deciding a lot of fear

813
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,840
about for the past, like 20 minutes,

814
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,280
because I just want to make it clear

815
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,120
that these exams are meant to be some sort of year.

816
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,160
They're not meant to be able to be scared.

817
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,000
The purpose of these exams are kind of like I mentioned earlier,

818
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,120
just is quite a few rental courts.

819
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
And the other types of the courts

820
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,800
tend to be a bit more practical,

821
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
especially your labs and your homework.

822
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But in exams, to get asking questions

823
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,200
that get more to the core of specific concepts,

824
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,000
for example, share a person with a mental leader,

825
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,640
choose, I don't know how I'm only thinking

826
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,160
about you later, really, really in danger now,

827
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,320
but those are two big topics.

828
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,080
These are big concepts.

829
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,720
Sometimes when we don't enter them,

830
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,760
we have to ask, create a couple examples,

831
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,240
really get a sense of where you are

832
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,760
and showing your understanding.

833
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,840
So how do you say it's a new exam?

834
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,380
Generally, I think kind of this is a back down

835
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,680
for life courts and courts.

836
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,000
And this isn't maybe what worked for everybody,

837
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,080
but I want to give you my background.

838
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
And maybe the last one of you

839
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,200
to also explain how you did it,

840
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,600
just to give you perspectives.

841
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,800
For me, usually, at the end of the first week,

842
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,680
I decided to push a lot to classes.

843
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,240
I would look at one of the first exams

844
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,280
from maybe the past year or all of our exams

845
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,680
are posted on the resources page as soon as.

846
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,000
You can access them there and take a look.

847
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
What I'm trying to say is I would look at that exam

848
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,600
and then it'll look like complete gibberish community, right?

849
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,000
If I want to be able to identify

850
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,440
what are the terms that come up the most often?

851
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,880
What are the types of problems that come up on this exam?

852
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,760
And then later on, in lecture, in discussion, in lab.

853
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,240
But when I see that term again,

854
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,680
when I see that there's a problem,

855
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,160
I notice a super important.

856
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,080
And I also know the levels of importance.

857
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,040
And so once I've seen a couple of those problems,

858
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,680
I do like to now go back and try out those past exam problems.

859
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,160
Because I've seen them before and now you know

860
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,720
of a learn the material when they got to that part of the course.

861
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,840
What I'm trying to get at is just one approach.

862
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,080
Some people don't like this because if it's world exam,

863
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,960
in my experience, I don't remember

864
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,480
and then I looked at me once,

865
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,280
so it feels well for me.

866
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,720
But what I'm trying to get at is not putting off exam settings

867
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,680
to be told because that'll make it a lot more stressful.

868
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,640
If you try to pack an exam problem every week,

869
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,000
at the end of the week or the end of the fall week

870
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,120
after went through that material,

871
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,720
you'll find that it's a lot easier

872
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,200
to figure out how to approach them and master them

873
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,240
and create strategies to tackle them.

874
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,320
I also really urge you to talk to your staff

875
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,480
about this, the TA's, because they'll have

876
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,640
the experience of them being able to relate to you

877
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,600
more closely and you don't experience it.

878
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,440
I guess one of the things I'll mention

879
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,960
is that all the resources page,

880
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,840
as we get further into the course,

881
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,880
for every topic will have specific lists

882
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,680
of the past exam problems from that topic.

883
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,800
So that's another way to study.

884
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,080
You can go through, all right,

885
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,360
we just went through higher functions.

886
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,480
We'll leave on the resources page

887
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,040
and try the past exam problems or higher responses.

888
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,600
Yeah.

889
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Alex also made this helpful flowchart.

890
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,640
So, what he is trying to believe here

891
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,360
is that you can start out with going to lecture

892
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,320
and then you can catch up with him, you can prefer that.

893
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,400
Then you go to lab, do some homework, go to discussion.

894
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,960
After that, he's no post-shaking on a concept.

895
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,640
That's what really sectioned it for.

896
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,800
Also tuning sections that you like.

897
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,040
And then after you have a foundation,

898
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,320
you should be ready to tell me

899
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,040
how those are naturally advanced.

900
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,400
It won't be difficult,

901
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,040
but the point of that little tooth

902
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,880
is that you do it over and over again.

903
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,520
I don't even know if you'd lecture in your test,

904
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,040
but I really want to encourage you to start early

905
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,280
and I think that'll really improve your experience.

906
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,600
Cool.

907
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
Any questions on the exams or the resources we have for that?

908
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,400
Yeah, you know?

909
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,240
We saw people asking about it.

910
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,080
Yes.

911
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,120
So, in here, there's no hours without,

912
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,960
you know, people preparing for exams work.

913
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,840
That's a good point.

914
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,000
So conceptual officers are,

915
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,600
they're kind of mentioned as purpose.

916
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,720
You go to conceptual office hours with past exam problems

917
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,560
and we're looking forward to helping you there.

918
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,400
You know what's good,

919
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,240
right?

920
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,920
They're office hours for sure.

921
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,080
You're free to do that as well.

922
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,520
Like a sexual or kind of specialized for this.

923
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,240
So yes, definitely a component.

924
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,360
Any other questions?

925
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,980
Cool.

926
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,200
I'm almost tired of these logistics.

927
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,520
I think this is the last slide.

928
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,360
Okay.

929
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,720
So just some stuff, an academic honesty

930
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
or put nicely collaboration.

931
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,400
So, this class is not clear.

932
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,640
They're acceptance.

933
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,280
This means that whether the 10 people next to you fail

934
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,600
because you, but I'm not going to admit to a scenario.

935
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,760
No one would happen to a student.

936
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,600
It's not going to change the green that you get.

937
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,840
So there's no incentive to do so, please.

938
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,800
So, instead, what you really want to call through this class

939
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,440
is an environment of collaboration, helping,

940
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,560
and sharing with one another.

941
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,080
We highly bridging work together

942
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,720
because really for me,

943
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,560
that's how we look at this class.

944
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,080
So my best friend was 16 one day.

945
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Wow, it's used right here.

946
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,280
And that's really the point of this operation.

947
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,920
Policy, but there are limits.

948
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,640
One, you cannot share code as anyone else in the courts

949
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,160
except for your project partner

950
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,320
on a project that you're working together on.

951
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,320
The only circumstance, yeah,

952
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,640
where you can look at someone else's code

953
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,600
is what your partner is.

954
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,480
So, sharing code with you the means,

955
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,800
if you're sitting together in your dorm

956
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,960
and you look at someone else's dreams

957
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,800
and you want to help them, that's still sharing code.

958
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,480
And it's explicitly not allowed.

959
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,080
We've run into what businesses or people say

960
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,920
that's all they're doing

961
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,120
and that's how they ended up with exact copies.

962
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,680
And even if you go to 10 this such,

963
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,480
it often happens inadvertently when you're programming.

964
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,880
So, please do not look at anyone else's code.

965
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,520
We also have software for detecting this,

966
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,640
and we will find out what's likely to do it.

967
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,560
So, that's just a warning.

968
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
Sorry to get to your software.

969
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay, so, if you wanted to just read anything I just said,

970
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,400
it's all on the website.

971
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,960
Chris, you're a very detailed documentation,

972
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,520
and now you can talk to Alex.

973
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay, so now we're going to dive into

974
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,040
the content of the course.

975
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,600
The first thing we're talking about is expressions.

976
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,360
So, what are expressions?

977
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,320
So, expression describes a computation

978
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,840
and evaluates to a value.

979
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,160
So, this is some way we can kind of symbolically

980
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,120
represent or programmatically represent some sort of

981
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,800
computation that we're going to be doing.

982
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,320
The field of mathematics has done this for a really long time.

983
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
They have numbers.

984
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,560
They represent things in a bunch of different ways.

985
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,200
Some of the ways, you put two numbers.

986
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,720
You put a plus sign between them.

987
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,800
Here you have some other format.

988
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,120
You have some line between them.

989
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,160
Competition's really love notation.

990
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,360
Here you put some number.

991
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,520
You put some house over it.

992
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,040
You get another number.

993
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,600
Here you just put a word and you get another value.

994
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,480
So, here you can use another language, Greek,

995
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,840
and you just suddenly have another thing.

996
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,800
So, and there's a bunch of these.

997
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay, so, mathematics has a lot of ways

998
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,400
that they like to describe things

999
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,360
because they like doing notation

1000
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,440
and having really short hand in the research papers.

1001
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,240
It's really hard to read.

1002
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,240
In computer science, we really like to simplify things.

1003
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,320
So, in computer science, the only thing

1004
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,040
that we really care about is this one

1005
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,560
a particular f of x.

1006
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,400
What this is kind of saying

1007
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,520
is that we're taking in some particular value

1008
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,480
and we're going to manipulate it in some way.

1009
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,400
Really general, it's really abstract.

1010
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,520
Take something, change it.

1011
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,680
The function f describes how we're going to change it.

1012
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,440
The input x is just the particular value

1013
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
that we care about.

1014
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,280
I claim that every single one of these kind of expressions

1015
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,520
or any other sort of expression

1016
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,120
that we might think about in math,

1017
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,360
that these can actually be represented

1018
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,000
in this f of x notation.

1019
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,840
And so, we're actually going to look at this in,

1020
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,320
Python, would somebody be willing to hold this

1021
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,960
since it isn't working?

1022
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,000
I think we're going to download.

1023
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,440
I put on a college shirt

1024
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,760
because supposedly they work best,

1025
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,480
but apparently they work worse.

1026
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,320
Not me or sis?

1027
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,160
Thank you.

1028
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,480
Okay, so,

1029
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,480
what I just did is I open me, this is just in Linux,

1030
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,520
it's similar in Mac and Windows,

1031
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,320
you'll probably use Git Bash.

1032
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,840
If I went to open the Python interpreter,

1033
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,080
I typed Python 3.

1034
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,480
So what this is, is it's a looping mechanism

1035
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,600
where we can type in things,

1036
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,080
Python figures out what the means

1037
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,040
and what I typed and then it returns the value.

1038
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,560
So for example, I can type 2019,

1039
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,080
it figures out what 2019 is,

1040
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,280
there's nothing special and we output that.

1041
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,280
The other thing we can do is we could do addition.

1042
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,520
We can output some other values.

1043
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,600
So here it's figuring out that we want to add to numbers.

1044
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,760
It calculates the addition and then puts them together.

1045
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,160
We can also do addition, we can do division,

1046
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,000
we can do more addition, we can do nested equations,

1047
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,880
we can do more multiple locations.

1048
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,800
And it automatically knows the sort of standard

1049
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,120
orders of operation and it'll sort of evaluate it

1050
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,440
in the normal way that we're used to.

1051
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,800
Another thing that we can do in the sort of functional

1052
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,000
notation that I was mentioning is there's some built in

1053
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,920
things that we can type.

1054
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,080
So we can say max of two numbers.

1055
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,040
It's going to return the value that it's a maximum.

1056
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,400
The function notation just says,

1057
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,040
okay, there's something that we want to call

1058
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,440
and we're to separate these in parentheses

1059
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,040
and put some commas between these things.

1060
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,880
This is how Python more or less knows

1061
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,960
that we're doing a function call.

1062
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,240
We can do min, calculates minimum.

1063
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,240
And this is great null, but I claim that we can do

1064
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,800
everything in this function call notation.

1065
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,960
Right here we're not doing this with the addition.

1066
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,200
And it doesn't quite work that we can't just do this.

1067
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,280
It's going to give some strange error

1068
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,840
that doesn't quite make sense.

1069
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,400
We actually have to do it, it's kind of the way

1070
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,600
Python works, we have to run this line.

1071
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,440
And this is kind of the underlying behavior

1072
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,080
of how the addition and multiplication works

1073
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,960
and it allows us to do this other format.

1074
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,560
So we can now add things together,

1075
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,440
we can multiply things together, let me.

1076
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,040
And another thing we can do is if you've ever seen

1077
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,480
in mathematics where we do multiple values

1078
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,520
in a particular function,

1079
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,840
we can actually just separate them in more commas.

1080
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,840
We'll get more values.

1081
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:55,640
We can also nest them, and it'll automatically figure out

1082
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,320
the order of evaluation based on the nesting structure.

1083
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,280
And so the nice part about using this call

1084
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,360
expression notation is it's very clear what goes where.

1085
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,920
We are going to evaluate the multiplication of 4 and 56

1086
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,520
before we add to do it.

1087
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,480
We're going to figure out what our validation is

1088
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,360
before we max that in the other addition.

1089
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,680
And sort of this nested structure makes it very clear.

1090
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,600
In the first lines that we're doing,

1091
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,240
you have to kind of know the order of operations

1092
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,160
of mathematics, and maybe you're too lazy

1093
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,160
and you don't remember that.

1094
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,200
Having this sort of consistent notation

1095
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,400
is very nice for program languages as well as computers

1096
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,960
because it just follows a simple set of rules

1097
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,640
and it'll figure out what it is.

1098
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,080
Are there any questions about that?

1099
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
All right, cool.

1100
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,480
Thank you.

1101
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,640
I don't know how to get back.

1102
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,320
Maybe.

1103
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,200
OK, so call expressions itself.

1104
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,240
We're going to look kind of like how they're formatted

1105
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,480
and how they work.

1106
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,400
So a general call expression here, we're saying add 2 and 3.

1107
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,960
This whole thing is what we call a call expression.

1108
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,200
The way you kind of know there's the name of the function.

1109
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,120
There's some parentheses.

1110
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,680
There's some values separated by commas.

1111
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,560
Some terminology we call add the operator.

1112
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,680
This is the thing that we're operating on the values.

1113
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,480
Add will do the addition.

1114
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,240
And the other things are calling operands.

1115
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,080
So operators apply to operands.

1116
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,440
We're applying add 2 and 3.

1117
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,440
In this case, it's not a particularly complex call

1118
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,280
expression, but in the case that we saw in the demo,

1119
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,520
we saw nested structures.

1120
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,480
So each of these values can also be expressions themselves.

1121
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,000
Instead of two, I could have said mole 5 and 6.

1122
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,720
And I could have had some other value.

1123
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,160
And it needs to sort of figure out these values

1124
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,680
before it does this kind of application.

1125
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,400
The exact way that Python goes about this

1126
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,960
is the first thing it does is it sees this as a call

1127
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,520
expression, it says, all right, I want to figure out

1128
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,880
what this evaluates to.

1129
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,080
So the first thing I'm going to do is figure out

1130
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,720
what is the operator?

1131
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,560
In this case, it's just looking up what add is.

1132
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,240
It says, OK, this is some thing that does addition,

1133
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,040
takes some numbers, and adds them together.

1134
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,560
The next thing it does is it goes through each of the

1135
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,040
operands.

1136
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,920
These are the arguments that we're plugging in.

1137
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,840
It figures out what 2 is, it figures out what 3 is.

1138
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,440
Now that we've kind of figured out all these values,

1139
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,160
and the reason why we're doing this is because in the case

1140
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,640
I mentioned, if 2 is instead mole 4 and 5,

1141
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,520
we have to figure out what 4 times 5 is before we can add

1142
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,040
4 times 5 and 3.

1143
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,560
Once we've figured out all these values,

1144
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,760
we can actually do this application.

1145
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,520
So we know what addition is.

1146
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,320
We know what 2 and 3 is.

1147
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,080
So now we can actually add 2 and 3 according to how

1148
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,920
addition works.

1149
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,520
By following this very precise sort of set of rules,

1150
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,000
it allows us to understand how computers are going about

1151
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
to calculate any arbitrary sort of value.

1152
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,520
And because it's so simple, and it's these sort of three

1153
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,800
relatively simple steps, computers can follow this

1154
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,320
relatively quickly.

1155
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,120
It says, all right, I don't have to really think about how

1156
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,000
this is structured.

1157
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,600
Do this step, this step, and then this step,

1158
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,600
and I'll have the result.

1159
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,760
So we're going to look at an example.

1160
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:03,080
So it's add, we're adding 6 and 4 times 6 as well as 3 times 5.

1161
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,960
So as people, the way we kind of approach this

1162
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,200
is we look from the inside out.

1163
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,840
The first thing that we're going to try and figure out

1164
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,800
is what's 4 times 6.

1165
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,160
We're going to get 24.

1166
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,920
Now after this, we're going to add 6 and 24.

1167
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,760
We're going to get 30.

1168
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,280
We're going to multiply 3 times 5, 15, and add these together.

1169
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,840
We're going to get 45.

1170
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,280
So when I look at this, I can quickly say, OK, what's the

1171
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,760
innermost call?

1172
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,920
OK, it's 4 times 6.

1173
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,520
So I should probably do that one first.

1174
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,880
You can also imagine saying, OK, I'll actually do 3 times 5.

1175
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,320
Then I'll do 4 times 6, and then I'll add them together,

1176
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,000
as long as we're kind of building up through the levels.

1177
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,280
Computers in Python can't quite do this.

1178
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,480
It needs to have a specific set of rules.

1179
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,920
And while we're kind of as people can look at the whole thing,

1180
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,960
kind of jump around and do whatever we want,

1181
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,600
programs need to follow a very specific set of rules.

1182
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,160
The way we would do this in sort of the following the 3 steps

1183
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,760
that we said before is we're going to follow these 3 steps.

1184
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,520
If I like to operator, the operands and apply.

1185
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,560
This is something that will be set a lot.

1186
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,920
I'm probably in discussion as well as lecture.

1187
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,320
And the process for this is here.

1188
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,880
We see a call expression.

1189
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,960
We're going to evaluate the operator.

1190
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,160
In this case, it's just addition.

1191
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
Nothing particularly complex.

1192
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,600
The next thing is the operand.

1193
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,400
We're going to add 6 and multiplication of 4 and 6.

1194
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,080
We have to figure out what this is before we can actually

1195
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,680
do the top level addition.

1196
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,360
To figure out what this value is, we have to repeat the set.

1197
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,760
Evaluate the operator.

1198
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,640
Evaluate the operand.

1199
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,640
In this case, it's 6.

1200
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,080
So we just get 6.

1201
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,480
And we repeat the process.

1202
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,040
We evaluate the operator, the operand, and the operand.

1203
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,040
Now for this sub-expression, mole 4 and 6,

1204
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,120
we figured out the first 2 steps.

1205
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,200
We've added, we figured out what the operator is.

1206
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,640
We figured out what the operands.

1207
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,440
We can now do this final step of applying things.

1208
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,960
We can say multiplication 4 times 6, the 24.

1209
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,600
We'll kind of go up this tree structure.

1210
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,240
Because it's like branching out.

1211
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,920
Then we'll say 6 plus 30.

1212
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,760
Now to figure out the top level, we have to kind of go

1213
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,200
through this again.

1214
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,440
And so this is how computers are actually

1215
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,240
going about solving these, like you've given instruction.

1216
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,800
It says, all right, let's compute this value.

1217
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,520
And this is a process that it's going through.

1218
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,400
It says, first, let's look at the uppermost level.

1219
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,600
All right, what are we looking at?

1220
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
A call expression.

1221
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,720
All right, let's look at the operator.

1222
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,520
Let's look at the operands.

1223
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,640
Let's kind of go through this structure

1224
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,480
and to figure out all of the possible values.

1225
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,120
And we kind of resolved ultimately what we're trying to do.

1226
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,600
There's whole things called an expression tree,

1227
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,920
where we have each of the things being the expressions.

1228
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,360
And they break into sub-expressions.

1229
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,640
And each of these evaluate to some particular value.

1230
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,800
Are there any questions about this?

1231
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,000
Cool.

1232
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,680
And then we're going to do another demo.

1233
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,240
Thank you.

1234
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,280
OK, so a couple of concepts in this course

1235
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,560
are functions, values, objects, interpreters, and data.

1236
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,960
So you've seen the interpreter.

1237
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,320
That's the type of interpreter.

1238
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,240
We can type in things.

1239
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,920
It evaluates things.

1240
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,520
I mentioned functions like add and mole.

1241
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,880
Values are like numbers.

1242
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,280
And we'll see a little bit of objects in data.

1243
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,480
In this demo, I'm going to be using some things

1244
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,000
that we haven't taught.

1245
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,880
But the point is not too confusing.

1246
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,320
The point is just if we had to introduce all these concepts,

1247
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,360
it would get to a cool demo in the first day.

1248
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,840
So we want to do that.

1249
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,320
So I'm just going to kind of do some things.

1250
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,600
You aren't going to have to understand everything.

1251
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,000
If you come back maybe later in this semester,

1252
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,560
some of these might make more sense.

1253
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,600
OK, so a long time ago, there is this author Shakespeare.

1254
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,800
I have a file on my computer.

1255
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,440
Actually, I think I need to.

1256
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,080
Nope.

1257
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,280
I misspelled Shakespeare.

1258
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,320
All right.

1259
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,160
Cool.

1260
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,600
So what this is, is this is a text document with a bunch,

1261
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,760
or I think all of Shakespeare's writings.

1262
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,440
So we can get the particular values,

1263
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,480
so we can read the data from this file,

1264
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,720
and then we can split these into words.

1265
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,200
This is going to be common.

1266
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,560
OK.

1267
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,800
So what is in this?

1268
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,040
We go to the first 25 words, and we see the first play,

1269
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,920
at least in this document.

1270
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,840
And it's a very nice game.

1271
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,360
That's the first words, and it tells the play itself.

1272
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,080
OK, so we can ask Python how many words are in Shakespeare?

1273
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,920
OK.

1274
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,360
So there's 980,000 words in all of the text of Shakespeare.

1275
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,520
If we're going to do this manually, it's take a long time.

1276
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,440
But Python did this pretty quick.

1277
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,560
So this is pretty impressive.

1278
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,160
But let's actually take a closer look.

1279
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,840
So let's ask, OK, how many of these words to Shakespeare write

1280
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,760
are actually the word the?

1281
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,400
So it turns out 23,000 of every word that Shakespeare wrote

1282
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,320
is just the word that is.

1283
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:41,960
So that's about 2%, something like that.

1284
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,640
I don't think we can look at is, if you notice, in the first line,

1285
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,760
we see a bunch of commas.

1286
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,120
So because of the way I split this, commas are also considered words.

1287
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,600
So let's actually look at how many commas there are.

1288
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,680
So there's actually 81,000 commas just in Shakespeare.

1289
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,600
So that's how many words are.

1290
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
We can figure out exactly what percentages

1291
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,600
by dividing this by how many words there are.

1292
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,080
We get about 8% of Shakespeare's just commas.

1293
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,360
And I think we do say, OK, there's a lot of repeats.

1294
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,600
Clearly, there's a lot of does.

1295
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,840
But maybe we're only interested in looking

1296
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,960
at the particular unique words.

1297
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,520
So the way we can do that is we can say, all right, only

1298
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:24,200
with unique words from Shakespeare.

1299
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:30,000
And now we can check, OK, is that in the words that Shakespeare has?

1300
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,520
Yeah, so it is.

1301
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,240
All right, how many words, unique words

1302
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,360
does Shakespeare use?

1303
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,520
OK, they have 33,000 unique words in Shakespeare.

1304
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,520
That's a lot.

1305
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,360
Another thing we can do is we can do some string manipulation.

1306
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,280
So here, if I put this thing in quotes,

1307
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,680
this is way Python says, all right,

1308
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,440
we're just going to type this string of characters in a word.

1309
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,040
Another thing we can do is we can actually reverse words.

1310
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,480
So now it's word.

1311
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,200
Oh, that's interesting.

1312
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,920
John Ward are both actually words.

1313
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,680
So maybe we can look in Shakespeare, which words are also

1314
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,880
inside of their reverse.

1315
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,640
So the way we do that is we're going to look over all the words.

1316
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,320
You don't have to understand what I'm doing right here.

1317
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,680
Yeah, OK, I guess that's a good point.

1318
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,240
We're going to clarify the goal of this.

1319
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,000
The goal is to show that Shakespeare has a lot of words.

1320
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,240
And the power of computers, it allows us to go through things

1321
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,160
automatically in order to see a lot of analysis and sort of data

1322
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,440
that would be really painful to do manually.

1323
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,040
Computers do this almost instantly and basically instantly.

1324
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,440
Well, if we were to do this manually, you'd take a long time.

1325
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,200
And so we can leverage the power of computers

1326
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,680
to sort of do this analysis on data, which

1327
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,920
was the other topic in this course.

1328
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,760
We've also seen sets, which are actually objects.

1329
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,080
And you can make believe these.

1330
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,840
We'll kind of cover each of these concepts

1331
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,480
that I mentioned a little bit more in depth throughout the course.

1332
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:09,080
OK, so here, I'm looking at all the words that are also

1333
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,080
the reverse of the words.

1334
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,960
So this is going to be palindroms, I guess.

1335
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,560
So we see all of the palindroms and Shakespeare, which

1336
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,800
are length greater than four, or these ones.

1337
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,160
So writer is also a writer, level is level.

1338
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,480
One of the thing we can do is we can look in Shakespeare.

1339
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,320
Maybe we only care about if the word is actually also in the words.

1340
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,360
So here, we're looking at all the words of length four,

1341
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,760
that when you take the word, you reverse it.

1342
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,880
It's also in Shakespeare.

1343
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:53,440
So let's see, there's, I don't know if these are words.

1344
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,120
I'm not quite.

1345
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,840
OK, gums and smug.

1346
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,360
Oh, snug.

1347
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,280
Oh, no, these are words.

1348
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,680
OK, move and pull.

1349
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,720
Yes, OK.

1350
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,760
This is why I guess the computer science major.

1351
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,480
OK, we can also look at length five.

1352
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,600
So we have some more.

1353
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,040
We can look at length six, all right.

1354
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,320
There's still some more.

1355
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,840
Are there seven?

1356
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,760
So there's no more.

1357
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,800
Are there any more greater than seven?

1358
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,200
OK.

1359
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,080
So we're kind of in our adoptions.

1360
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,760
And the reason for this is Shakespeare didn't use all of the words

1361
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,760
of the English dictionary.

1362
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,720
We can also actually load in, let's see.

1363
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,720
I need to figure out the document.

1364
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,120
So on my computer, I have a file.

1365
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,080
You don't have to understand this.

1366
00:55:39,080 --> 00:56:02,760
OK, so now I've loaded in the dictionary of all of the words

1367
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,880
on my computer, at least in this one dictionary.

1368
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,360
So now, look at the length of words, there's now 102,000.

1369
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,880
So originally we had, I think, 30-ish,000.

1370
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,360
So we've increased the number of words by a lot.

1371
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,240
So we can do things like, OK, what

1372
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,240
is the longest word in this list of words or a set of words?

1373
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,600
We can take all the words.

1374
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,200
We can say, all right, what I care about

1375
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,640
is the length of these.

1376
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,360
OK, so this is the longest word in the dictionary.

1377
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,880
Oh, I'm not going to try to pronounce that.

1378
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,880
We can also look alphabetically.

1379
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,720
We can say, OK, what's the last word in the dictionary alphabetically?

1380
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,760
We get it toads.

1381
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,800
Let's see, what else can we do?

1382
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,680
We can go back to the original thing we had.

1383
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,480
We're saying all the words, which also have reverses in it,

1384
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,960
which are length 6.

1385
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,360
So we see there's a little bit more words.

1386
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,760
And then we can, again, are there

1387
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,920
anyone's greater than 6?

1388
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,520
So in this case, we actually have more of these.

1389
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:16,160
So stressed and desir, desir, oh, OK, OK, so we can actually,

1390
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,480
for example, we could say, OK, what is the largest word?

1391
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:30,960
Such that.

1392
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,880
So we're looking at the longest word

1393
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,200
in this set of words, such that the reverses in it.

1394
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,520
And we get stressed and desir.

1395
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,020
Cool.

1396
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,240
OK, so this is kind of all I have for this.

1397
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,440
Are there any other things you guys would be interested in looking at

1398
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,160
what we could do in this sort of data set?

1399
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:57,240
Maybe like looking up words that are, I don't know,

1400
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,200
are there any ideas?

1401
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:58,680
Yeah.

1402
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,040
How many words start with A?

1403
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,240
How many words start with A?

1404
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:11,440
OK, so we could take how many words, if the first letter is A?

1405
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,360
So 4,600, so many things.

1406
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,400
And then I think, yeah, so some of these, let's say,

1407
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:36,120
let's say, this, except now, we're going to look at that for.

1408
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,400
OK, so 6,000 words, ignoring capitalization, start with A.

1409
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,280
Any other guess?

1410
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,800
Yeah.

1411
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,440
Is there a simple way in it?

1412
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,160
So instead, in that stop-up, I mean,

1413
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,640
that's stressed and dessert is another thing,

1414
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,360
versus avoiding A, so that those between ones won't be there.

1415
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:57,760
So we only care about, so if there's a word like stress,

1416
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,840
you don't care about the inverse of it.

1417
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:04,960
Yeah, so in other words, you can do that is back in this one.

1418
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,800
Not this one.

1419
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,760
So another thing we can say is, I can't hear a people if you want this

1420
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,160
too.

1421
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
Oh, yeah.

1422
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,720
Thank you.

1423
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,480
He asked, is there anything we could exclude the reverse of the

1424
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:14,680
word?

1425
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,280
So we got stressed, but maybe we don't want desserts as well.

1426
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,680
Or maybe we want desserts, but not stressed, if you don't

1427
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,080
want to reverse.

1428
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:29,560
So the way you can do that is we can say, and we only care

1429
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,200
about the one that is actually smaller alphabetically.

1430
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,440
So we get two of them.

1431
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:36,880
Cool.

1432
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,400
So this actually excluded palindromes.

1433
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,040
We can actually say less than or equal if we care about palindromes.

1434
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,560
Cool.

1435
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,640
Because deified is also the reverse.

1436
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,640
Yeah.

1437
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,600
How is the number that's not had out for this?

1438
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,640
Do you know what that is?

1439
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,640
Do you know what that is?

1440
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,640
That's what that is.

1441
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,280
That's what the word is.

1442
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,760
Um, I'm interested in what are the words that

1443
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,320
store the capital H or the lower key say?

1444
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:18,200
This might elucidate something.

1445
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,920
There's a lot.

1446
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:33,880
Oh, so the reason why is let's look at...

1447
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,240
So some of these words like arctic also have the capitalization.

1448
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,120
So when we lowercase them, we don't care about the ones

1449
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,120
that we're also duplicated.

1450
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,160
Any other ideas?

1451
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
Yeah.

1452
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,440
Most number of vowels.

1453
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,440
Most number of vowels.

1454
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,440
Okay.

1455
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,480
So we can say, um, we're going to max over the words, uh, you

1456
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,800
don't need to know what this means, uh, I'm going to say...

1457
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,800
But you will see.

1458
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,240
You'll be able to understand all of this.

1459
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
Yes.

1460
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:22,360
And we want to, um, uh, one for W in X if, uh, let's see, uh,

1461
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:44,960
so this is the word that has the most, uh, like the word that has the most, uh,

1462
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:56,920
the most repeating single letter, um, so we can say, we want the maximum word where the

1463
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:03,320
key is equal to, well, okay, so we can do it with a specific vowel.

1464
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:09,280
So if I said which one has the most ease, we get teleconference, it's a X, which one

1465
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:17,600
has the most X's, X ons, not quite sure how you do with all of the letters, though.

1466
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,680
Yeah, you'd have to kind of go through all the letters and then get the maximum over

1467
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,680
all of those.

1468
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,240
So we'd have to sit here and type a long string with the whole alphabet.

1469
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,280
We could do it, but it'll take a while.

1470
01:02:31,280 --> 01:03:00,000
Oh, yeah, he's saying like, um, he's saying to the subtract the set of unique letters

1471
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,760
from the length of the word, um, because then you'll have a, but like, I think that that

1472
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,760
version, right?

1473
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,480
So if you have two letters that both repeat a lot, you want to certainly get the one word

1474
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,000
with the most repeats of the same letter, right?

1475
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,760
Like, okay, basically the probably isn't easy way to do this, but we don't know if the

1476
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:35,360
top of our head, but I think that approach would, I mean, yeah, you could say, oh, my

1477
01:03:35,360 --> 01:04:03,360
God, okay, so I'm iterating over all the letters and I'm saying, and now it's intact.

1478
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:21,720
Oh, no, I don't need this, nope, generics, oh, okay, I see, I have the most A's, I guess,

1479
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:29,040
wait, that's like not that many A's, I think maybe it's a lot of A's, yeah, I guess I

1480
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:41,120
guess it's a lot of A's, yeah, use a regular expression, maybe, I'm not very good at

1481
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:54,720
regular expression, okay, cool, yes, I can hold it up for you, cool.

1482
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,680
So I guess the purpose is going to show you some neat things you can do in Python, you

1483
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,120
can actually download the Shakespeare text, it's in the textbook, I think it's one of the

1484
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,960
first links, if you go to the 1.1 chapter, if you want to mess around with it yourself,

1485
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:11,000
it's just kind of show you the neat things you can do in Python, what kind of moving on

1486
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,560
to some other kind of building up and maybe by the end of the semester, you kind of understand

1487
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:20,320
all the specific things that we've done and how you might approach these for yourself.

1488
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:34,680
Anyway, tomorrow, thank you all for coming, we'll be up here if you have any questions.

1489
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:57,320
Thank you.
