All right, we're going to do some visualizations today.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.800
Let's have some here.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.000
I see a couple there.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.680
All right, tell them please.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.080
Announcements, same as last time.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.040
Thank you for all those people who are keeping their hands up.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.600
But please take advantage of all that seats.

04:50.600 --> 04:50.960
Thank you.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.440
Same as last time, homework is you tomorrow.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.760
You get an extra point for turning it in today.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.040
The routine is the same every week.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.920
Small group tutoring sessions have been announced on Piazza.

05:04.920 --> 05:09.120
If you feel that it might help you, then please take advantage of it.

05:09.120 --> 05:09.920
They're filling up.

05:09.920 --> 05:18.240
OK, I want to pick up where we left off last time.

05:18.240 --> 05:25.680
What we had done last time was we had gone through a series of table operations on columns

05:25.680 --> 05:26.440
and rows.

05:26.440 --> 05:30.920
And then we had taken a dataset from the census.

05:30.920 --> 05:37.480
And we were just about to start looking at the data and interpreting it when time was up.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.160
So let's review where we were.

05:42.960 --> 05:48.280
As we said last time, the census is a every 10 year thing.

05:48.280 --> 05:52.960
Every 10 years, the US government counts.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.840
The number of people in the United States.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.680
And it's not citizens or anything.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.160
It's just how many people are in the United States.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.360
And the reason for doing that is the Constitution says that there are

06:05.360 --> 06:10.120
a portionment, representation, and federal funds and so on

06:10.120 --> 06:14.320
are connected with the number of people in each state.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.040
This is a massive undertaking.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.120
It's quite difficult.

06:18.120 --> 06:23.160
But it's done every 10 years and also in between those 10-year periods.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.360
There are estimates made every year.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.600
So that people are prepared for what might come up in the next census.

06:29.600 --> 06:34.360
And governments and so on can make policy based on more current data than

06:34.360 --> 06:36.480
data from 10 years ago.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.800
We saw a dataset that we had loaded from the census.

06:43.800 --> 06:50.360
And there was a sex column, which had some codes.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.000
And then there was an age column with age and years.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.800
And I'll just go over.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.720
The sex column had a numerical code for male female.

06:59.720 --> 07:04.480
And the estimates were done at a particular time.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.840
The population estimates were done at a particular time of the year.

07:08.840 --> 07:12.840
The columns also had some aggregated data.

07:12.840 --> 07:19.400
So the sex column, when you see a code of zero, it was everybody.

07:19.400 --> 07:25.680
And the remarkable age of 99 years is actually not 99 years at all.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.040
It was everybody of all ages.

07:30.040 --> 07:36.400
So instead of writing male and female, or everyone,

07:36.400 --> 07:37.680
they were using numeric codes.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.520
This is for storage efficiency.

07:40.520 --> 07:44.640
And also, because you don't want to be typing words all the time.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.840
Often, very often, numerical codes are used.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.800
That doesn't mean they're actually numbers.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.960
I'll come to that later.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.120
So values in a column have the same type.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.040
You know that they're arrays.

07:57.040 --> 08:01.320
The point that we're trying to make here at the end is age 12 is actually 12 years old.

08:01.320 --> 08:01.880
That's a kid.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.280
You can imagine that age 9.99 is not an age.

08:05.280 --> 08:09.600
It's a number here, as far as a computer is concerned, but it's not an age.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.680
And when we interpret data in tables, we have to keep things like that in mind.

08:13.680 --> 08:18.760
And where do you know what's going on, like what these codes mean?

08:18.760 --> 08:22.000
You have to read the documentation provided by the people who made the table.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
And so there's a link to that at the bottom there.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
So what I'd like to do is I'd like to get started by reviewing where we were.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
So there was a census data.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
The census provides data in this file right here.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And we read it into a table called full.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
And that has a sex column and age column and various population columns,

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
from which we selected four columns into a partial table,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
which we called partial.

08:58.000 --> 09:06.000
This thing had a 306 rows, and it had sex age.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
The estimate in 2010 and the estimate in 2014 of the total population.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
And it's broken down by each group and each label for sex.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
We did not like these long column labels, and so we did some relabeling.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
We relabeled that long pop estimate 2010 to be just 2010,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
and then we were too lazy to even type in pop estimate 2014.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
So we just used the column index there.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
We relabeled column three to be column 2014, and we took a look at that.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
And now you have a table that is a little easier to comprehend and work with,

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
and so that's what we're going to start doing.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
I think last time we had also decided that we didn't like looking at large numbers

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
and not knowing how big they were, so we used number four matter.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
And now you can see that you have essentially four million people in each of those cells.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Every age group, four million people, and these are the little tiny ones,

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
age zero through nine that you can see.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
But then the table continues.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
We took a look at the age labels, and there was 9.99.

10:35.000 --> 10:44.000
So we've seen everybody put together, everybody of all ages, put together there.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
Sex was one male, two females, zero, everybody, and so what we're going to do now

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
is because it is extremely disconcerting to work with ages of 999.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
We're going to do some further reduction of this table.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
I'd like you to look at age 100.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Age 100 there isn't exactly 100 years, it's 100 plus.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
Everybody, 100 plus was lumped in there, and that's where the numbers are bigger.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
And we'll look at them again.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
But so even 100 isn't 100 years old, it's 100 plus, 999 is everybody.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
So now, I will take one short pause for questions.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
This is exactly where we were, I think, last time.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
So the first thing we'll do is we will get rid of the 999.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
So I'll create a table called no 999, where you take this table and you take the rows where the age,

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
column index one, are below 999.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
And I do that, and I don't see anything because that's an assignment statement.

12:02.000 --> 12:10.000
That's fine.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm not going to run the same thing twice.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
What I'm going to do is I'm going to extract a table for everybody.

12:19.000 --> 12:30.000
So from this, every row where sex is equal to zero, and then we'll make a table for the guys.

12:30.000 --> 12:47.000
And for the girls and the women, and so we create those three tables.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
And we take a look at table called females.

12:52.000 --> 13:06.000
And so that's, okay, at every age zero through 100, you have the number of females in the years 2010 and the year 2014.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
And I look at that sex column.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Well, this is the table of females.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Every single one of them is going to be a two.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
That's rather boring.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
So we should not be carrying around a column that just has all two's in it.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
So how about we go back?

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
We haven't messed with no 99, so we're just going to drop column zero here for all of them.

13:25.000 --> 13:34.000
Okay.

13:34.000 --> 13:40.000
Now, actually, we have some data there that are interesting to look at.

13:40.000 --> 13:48.000
So we have the females, and we have the males as well, and I have a question for you.

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
So you can see that there's slight differences in how many females there are at each age group.

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
For example, there are more of more nine-year-olds than tiny, tiny, tiny infants.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
You see that?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah?

14:03.000 --> 14:10.000
So among the females, which age do you think is the most populous?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Talk to your friends and neighbors.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
You can't tell that from here.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
You just have to guess based on what you know.

14:17.000 --> 14:46.000
All right.

14:46.000 --> 14:53.000
Since everybody is guessing, everybody is guessing somebody call out a guess.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Sorry?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Five zero?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Six zero.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Six.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Somebody guess a 60 roughly why?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Baby boom.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
All right.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
That's a good guess.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Others.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Other candidates?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Yes?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Above 100.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Above 100.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
All right.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Because there's lots of ages in there.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
More.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
37, because.

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
Because there's lots of ages in there.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Close it up.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Baby boom.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
They haven't died yet.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Okay.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Great.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
So then more of it, as it might seem, that is exactly the kind of thing you have to think

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
about, yes.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
About 20?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
About 20, why?

15:37.000 --> 15:43.000
Because that would be about when the generation above the liners are stopping being the major

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
segment of producing kids since millennials are notoriously not producing kids.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, wow.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
So now we're looking at millennials.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
There's a lot of them, but they don't have a lot of kids.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
And so maybe their kids are all over 20.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
So now maybe let's look at the 20-year-olds and there's a lot of them.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
So shall we actually look?

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
Let's actually look.

16:03.000 --> 16:19.000
What?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
No.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
No.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
No.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I already know that 100 is bigger than 99.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
This is silly.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Okay.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
So I'm just going to look at the 2014 population.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
So who said 60?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I think you're the closest.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
All right.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
So there's more in 2014.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
There were more 54 or 53-year-old women than anything else.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
20, somebody said 20s.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
You had 20s.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Somebody else had 20s?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Yeah.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
So you guys weren't doing so badly.

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
But you can see they're all sort of in the 50s and in the 20s.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Which is interesting.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
It's quite interesting to see whether the picture is the same for

17:11.000 --> 17:24.000
the men.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
No.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Not the same for the men.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Most common for men is 23.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
There is a 54.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You can see what is way down.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
All right.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
And so these very dry numbers are telling a story.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
They're telling a story that guys' lives are genuinely different from

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
women's lives.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And also their biology are different.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
So what we're going to do now is we're going to take a look a

17:51.000 --> 18:05.000
little more carefully at these data and maybe what we can do is

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
create one table with both genders.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
So let's just call it population 2014.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
So I'm just going to look at the year 2014 and you can change

18:18.000 --> 18:30.000
it later.

18:30.000 --> 18:45.000
So for age I can pick any one of these first columns.

18:45.000 --> 19:10.000
So I'm going to take a look at the picture.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
Okay.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
So look at the number of males compared to the number of females at

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
these different age groups.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Do you notice something?

19:24.000 --> 19:31.000
Consistently fewer little girls than boys of the same age.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Look at age zero.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Those are the kids just born.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The proportion of females is not 50%.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
This has long been the case and there's some biology that I

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
does not clear to me is completely well understood.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
The proportion, a baby born is slightly less likely to be a

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
female than male.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
And at all of these ages, the proportion of females is

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
slightly less.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Why don't we just work out what the proportion is and then

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
we'll take a look at what that looks like across all the

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
ages that we can't see.

20:06.000 --> 20:14.000
So we'll create an array called percent females.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Okay.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
So we will convert these numbers to a percent of the total.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Yep.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
How do I find the total?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Well, it's a sum of these two.

20:25.000 --> 20:38.000
So we will take white dot column and not select because it's

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
an array.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
I want to do arithmetic with it.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
I don't want to just visualize on the table.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
I want to do some arithmetic.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Okay.

20:44.000 --> 20:59.000
I've got to take it and add it.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
And if I do that, I will get a fraction.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
So why don't I convert that into a percent by multiplying by

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
100.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
And then we create a new table called counts and

21:14.000 --> 21:23.000
percent, which is our old table pop 2014.

21:23.000 --> 21:46.000
Okay.

21:46.000 --> 22:04.000
So just about 49% female throughout in these age groups.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Okay.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
So now what does this look like for all the other age groups?

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Of course, we could turn the table over and sort by age in

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
descending order and take a look.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
But it's a good idea to draw a picture.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
It's just crying out for us to draw a picture.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And so what we will do is we will now draw some

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
line graphs.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
These are plots.

22:24.000 --> 22:36.000
And so I will take the table dot plot produces a line graph.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
And we will plot the age on the horizontal axis.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
So the columns are age, and we will plot a percent female on

22:45.000 --> 22:55.000
the vertical.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
That is interesting.

22:57.000 --> 23:04.000
You start out proportion female is just below 50% by about 40

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
males and females in equal proportions and what happens to

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
the senior citizens.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
At the higher ages, you're seeing quite substantially more

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
females than males.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
So that is an interesting observation from this graph.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
And we look at it a little more carefully.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I just want to go over the call.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
So if you want, you have a table of data and you want to draw

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
a line plot of one column versus another, then table dot

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
plot to you can use two arguments.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
The first one will represent the horizontal axis and the

23:41.000 --> 23:50.000
second one will represent the vertical.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
All right.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
So what would be nice is to look at the males and

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
females separately and possibly on the same graph if possible.

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
So let's take a look at pop 2014 again.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
These are accounts, not percents.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
What we're going to do is we're going to take two plots on

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
the same graph.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
These are called overlaid plots.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
And so I'm going to plot the males versus age and the

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
females versus age.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
And to do that, I just have to specify which is the x-axis.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Then every single other column will be plotted as the y-axis.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
So there will be a separate graph for every single other column.

24:35.000 --> 24:47.000
So these accounts.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
Number of people in each age group and the blue graph represents

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
the males and the gold graph represents the females.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
So this is another way of visualizing what we just did before

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
I do that.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Any questions about the call?

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
If your data set, so our data set had everything numerical,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
there was a column of ages and then there were numbers.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
If you had a column of names as well, then plot would be

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
unhappy.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
So select the things that you want to plot and then work

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
with table like that.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
All right.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
So you can see what we saw before.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
That is up to the age of about 40.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
There are fewer females than males.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Around 40, it overlaps.

25:32.000 --> 25:41.000
And then by the end, there are more females than males.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
And there's some fluctuation.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
The numbers aren't always the same.

25:44.000 --> 25:56.000
It's going to move all about, except there's a plummet here.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
That's unusual.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Just a very sharp drop.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
And so what we're going to do is we're going to see what was

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
happening at those ages.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
And these ages are right about here.

26:04.000 --> 26:28.000
So why don't we look at, OK.

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
Take a look at those numbers.

26:35.000 --> 26:43.000
See what you spot.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
Do you see the plummet?

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
The very sharp drop, one age to the next.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Where is it?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Which age?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
67.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Right.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
If you look from 67 to 68, you have it's 1.8 million versus

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
1.3 million.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Something happened there.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
Right.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
And there's something else going on.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
71 to 72.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
There's something noticeable going on there.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
And so what would be very nice to see is who are those people.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And so what we're going to do is we're going to figure out

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
the bonds.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Right.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
So if somebody is 67 in the year 2014, these are only from 2014,

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
then you can figure out when they were born by subtracting their age

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
from 2014.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
And so we are going to do 2014 minus.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
We don't need to do all of them.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
I don't think how about we do 67.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
OK.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
Somebody, before we run, there's somebody

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
explained to me what's going to happen.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
2040 is a number, I'm subtracting off what type of object.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
It's an array.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
And so what is that operation going to do?

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
Element-wise, one element at a time, right?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
So it is going to return what?

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
It's going to evaluate to what?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
An array.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
And the first element of that array is going to be 2014 minus 67.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
The second element of the array is going to be 2014 minus 68 and so on.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And what's the purpose of doing this?

28:24.000 --> 28:31.000
It's to find out what these people were born in.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
So take a look at that.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
1942 to about 1947.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
What was going on in the United States in those years?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
War.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Right?

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
So Pearl Harbor was in 1941.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
And so if you look at the oldest people, the 72-year-olds,

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
that's what you're seeing there.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
And then there's some number of bits.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
And so the war ends around here.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Everybody gets home.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
It takes a while to have a baby.

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
And then in 1947, suddenly there's a lot of babies.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
And that's pretty much what you're seeing here.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
So the point of this is not just to show you the method calls,

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
but to notice that something as,

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
suddenly, prosaic as census data can tell stories if you look at them

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and ask questions.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
And so we encourage you when you look at any data set to ask why

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
to notice unusual blips and to ask why they are.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
And sometimes you learn something quite interesting.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
OK.

29:50.000 --> 29:57.000
We had one data set that had everybody in it.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
What we're going to look.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
This is now looking at the change from 2010 to 2014.

30:03.000 --> 30:19.000
So.

30:19.000 --> 30:48.000
Is somebody watching YouTube?

30:48.000 --> 31:01.000
And if you insist on doing that, it's called earbuds.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Thank you.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
All right.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
So this column represents the change in population between 2010 and 2014.

31:11.000 --> 31:36.000
And no surprise there, the biggest change was at 67 years old

31:36.000 --> 31:50.000
because the 67 years old in 2014, those are not the same people.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
How old were they in 2010?

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Sorry?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
63.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
You have a jump there.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
And so what I'd like you to do is I'm not going to dwell on this particular column now.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
What you're noticing is that what I'd like you to do as an exercise at home

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
is to see how you can reconcile this with what we just said.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
The 67-year-olds, there was a jump there.

32:16.000 --> 32:23.000
This is another way of looking at the same element.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
What I'd like to do is actually I would like to look at growth rates because I have heard from

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
core staff that people are unhappy about growth rates.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
Instead of looking just at absolute change, I would like to look at rate of change here.

32:39.000 --> 32:47.000
And before I do that, I'd like to ask your patients, I want to take you through a little discussion of what growth

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
rates are and how that calculation comes about.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
And then we're going to use it.

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
I've heard from numerous staff that growth rates caused unhappiness.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
So, okay, let's see if we can be a little less unhappy.

33:02.000 --> 33:08.000
So, a rate you can think of as a percent or a proportion.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
So, there's some growth rate.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Don't worry about the letters.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
Just think of it as 3%.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.000
If a population you start at a certain point, you have some initial value.

33:22.000 --> 33:30.000
And you end up at a certain point after a specified period of time, then you have grown.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
And you have grown, we say, at a certain rate.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
And what we're going to do is figure out what that means.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
Okay, so after one time period, just assume that you start with something that we're calling x.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
You can take it to be 100 if you wish.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
After one time period, you have your x plus you have 3% of x.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
Okay, so that's the total population that you have.

33:54.000 --> 34:00.000
And a little bit of pulling out the x says that after one period you have,

34:00.000 --> 34:07.000
what you started with initially times one plus the growth.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
So, what I'd like to do is just fix the growth rate to be 3% in our heads.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
For an example, if I start out with a thousand people,

34:16.000 --> 34:27.000
then what I have at the end of one period is 1,000 people times 1.03.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Right?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
And that is the base of the calculation.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
At every period, you see, what am I starting with now?

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
And then you multiply that by one plus the rate.

34:39.000 --> 34:45.000
And so therefore, you agree?

34:45.000 --> 34:51.000
At the second period, you are starting out with where you were at the end of the first period.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.000
And so you were at x times 1 plus g.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
So 1,000 times 1.03.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
So you take that number and you multiply that again by 1.03.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Questions about this line?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
This is the crucial line and everything else is just okay,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
so now we're going to do it for a bunch of periods.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
So for the third period, I'm going to take this as my starting point

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
because that's how many people I have now and I'm going to multiply it by another 1 plus g.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
And so I'll get a 1 plus g cubed and so on.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
And so if you have t, this is t for time period,

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
if you have t periods, then at the end of t period,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
you'll have your initial initial starting point, which is x,

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
and then your 1 plus your growth rate, 1.03,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
to the power of your time periods.

35:40.000 --> 35:47.000
And so what does this do? This says, if you know your initial point,

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
that is how many people you had at the start, that's x.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
And you know the growth rate, right?

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
You know that you're going to be increasing at 3% a year.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Then this is what helps you figure out where you're going to end up.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
This is what helps you figure out what your ending point is going to be.

36:04.000 --> 36:10.000
So this is what I call the forwards direction calculation.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
I know where I'm starting, I know what the rate's going to be,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
I figure out where I'm going to end up.

36:15.000 --> 36:20.000
Very often, we know where we're starting, we know where we ended up,

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
and the question that comes up is, what did the rate have to be to make this possible?

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
That is what I call the backwards calculation.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
I know the start, I know the end, I don't know the rate,

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
but maybe I can figure out what did the rate have to be to get from this particular start to this particular end.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
And so for that, what you have to do is you basically have to solve for G in this equation.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
And so the next thing that I'm going to write down, if you don't like solving for stuff, just tune out.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
But if you do like solving for stuff, then you can see that this is just, I'm just going backwards.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
You will never have to do this in this class.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
I'm just, there are some people in the room who find it more reassuring if they know where stuff came from,

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
so I'm just telling you where it comes from.

37:06.000 --> 37:15.000
And so this back calculation is what leads to the formula that you have been using in your labs for growth rate,

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
which is to figure out what rate could have got you from initial x to ending y.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
You take ending divided by initial, raise it to this funny power, which is one over the time periods,

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
and take the whole thing and subtract off one.

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
That's where that thing comes from.

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
If we ask you to do growth rates in exams, we will provide you with the formula.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
You don't have to worry about it, right?

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
But I want you, you should have some sense of where these things come from,

37:49.000 --> 37:59.000
and this is a little description of where it comes from, say, two minutes for questions.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Yeah.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Did that give you a little growth rate from the beginning,

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
not just the growth rate from the period?

38:07.000 --> 38:12.000
This is the annual, so I just think of periods as years.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
This is the annual growth rate that would, if you were compounded,

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
would have led you from x to y in T periods.

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
It is a per year rate.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Okay, so we're just going to apply this thing.

38:29.000 --> 38:39.000
You've done it before in lab, I just want to make sure that we're okay with doing this.

38:39.000 --> 39:06.000
Okay, so here, so we're going from 2010 to 2014,

39:06.000 --> 39:21.000
so it's going to be everyone.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
Why did I do that?

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
Tell column two divided by dot column one, why did I do that?

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
I'm not done yet, but why did I do this?

39:38.000 --> 39:44.000
That's taking the end value dividing by the initial value that we said we had to do,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
and then what we have to do to this?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
We have to raise it to a power.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Yep.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
One over how many time periods were there.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
If we're looking for an annual growth rate, how many time periods were there?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Excuse me, now you can see.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
Four, there were four time periods.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
After having done all that, we have to subtract off one from this,

40:05.000 --> 40:34.000
and what we're going to do is we're going to look at sort.

40:34.000 --> 40:57.000
Okay, I'm going to shut up, look at that.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.000
See what needs to change, see what that's telling you.

41:03.000 --> 41:28.000
There's something a little alarming about that.

41:28.000 --> 41:41.000
Okay, why have we done here that isn't working out correctly?

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
You know, I'm not happy about this at all.

41:47.000 --> 41:57.000
Where did I make everyone?

41:57.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah, just a moment, let me just come back to where I was.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Yes, yes, yes, there's a parenthesis issue.

42:17.000 --> 42:26.000
I'm just trying to recompute the, it's this.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Okay, so we were all unhappy because of why?

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Because the minus signs.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Yes, the populations are increasing, you can't have minuses.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Something was wrong in that calculation.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
And because of the, this thing doesn't fix itself going back up,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
I had to recalculate the entire table and come back down,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
and I didn't want to do run all above.

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
So, okay, let's try this.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
It's much better.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Much better.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Positive growth rate because you can see from 2010 to 2014,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
the numbers are higher.

43:04.000 --> 43:11.000
Yep, okay, all of these are around 0.07, 0.06.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Where's the highest rate of growth?

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
The very, very, very, very senior people.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
And if you compare to, like the 1960s,

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
the people in those age groups, like 9900,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
and the people who are 100 and up,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
they have grown by almost 75%.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
There's a very significant growth in that age group.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
And this is, you know, a very vivid picture of the grain of America.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
Okay, so what I'd like to do today is we've had a lot of discussion of

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
wars, people getting old, and so on and so forth,

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
and at your age group, it's a little depressing.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
So, I want to look at something a little more and light,

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
but yes.

44:01.000 --> 44:20.000
No, we're looking at annual growth rate.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
For you.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
For you.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
For you.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
Rate for you.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
Annual rate.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
Okay, let's quickly summarize, actually not summarize.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
There are, there's language that we just use.

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
I want it on slides, so that you know.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
That is actually statistical terminology,

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
and not just some terms that we're making up here.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Types of data.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
You know that everything in the column should have the same type,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
and be comparable in some way.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
We are now bringing that in because you've had ages of 23 and 54,

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
and a so-called age of 999, and you shouldn't be working with that

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
999 at the same time as the 23 and 54.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Okay, numerical.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Numerical measurements.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
They're on the real line necessarily.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
They're ordered.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
53 is bigger than 21.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Differences matter, right?

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
There is a, it's a length or a time period difference.

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
Categorical is like if you are looking at favorite colors,

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
so categories, red, blue, green.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Each value is from a fixed inventory.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
It just means that there are, you know, there are, you have a total set of five colors,

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
and each person will give you one of those five colors.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
May or may not have an ordering.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
So here's some categorical data.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
You do a little rating of something, and you are not satisfied.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Some what's satisfied, very satisfied.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Those are categories, but they have a natural ordering.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
And so some categories may be ordered, but red, blue, green is not necessarily ordered.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Categories are the same or different.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Well, so are numbers.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
But the point is you can't have fractional differences in between, right?

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
You're either in this category or you're in that, and we will choose a category

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
so that we don't have a collapse.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Okay, so this is now so-called numerical data.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
Just because the data on numbers doesn't mean the variable is numerical,

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
so your sex code had number 0, 1, 2, but you can't subtract and take averages

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
of those numbers. It doesn't make sense.

46:33.000 --> 46:40.000
They're just labels, and you could just as well have called them red, blue, and green.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
And so one of the things that happens is there's a big discussion as to whether

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
course evaluations of teachers, how they should be summarized.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
So at the end of the term, you have to do a course evaluation.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
And there's a, you know, would you rate the effectiveness of this course,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
and there's like a one through five scale?

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Yep.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
So you're giving back a number, and it sure looks like a number, but it's a category, right?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
It's your rating of that person.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I use somewhat satisfied, very satisfied.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Basically, it's a category. And then what we get back are averages of those numbers,

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
and we're looking at that going, I'm not really very sure what this average means.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
Because after all, one person's four, and somebody else's four,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
might mean quite different things, right?

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
And in any case, those numbers don't make any sense.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
So there are, it just keeps us in mind.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
And so the variable sex is still categorical, even though the numbers were used for categories.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
Okay, so we know how to do line plots.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
We're now going to quickly see another kind of plot, and I hope to get you something interesting.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
We have just about enough time. Okay.

47:46.000 --> 47:54.000
So you will have noticed, you will have noticed that I'm really bad at typing,

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
like really bad at typing, especially in a lecture in front of 700 people.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
It just doesn't work.

48:01.000 --> 48:07.000
So when the function calls are simple, and there's really not much new going on,

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
you will often find that I've already populated the notebook.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
I will take you through what is typed there, and then we'll hit return.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
So that you don't have to go through me going back and correcting my own mistakes over and over again.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
Okay.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to, there's a table called Actors.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
We are going to take a look at these people.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
There are 50 actors in this table, and about 2015, they were the people that had.

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
Okay, so now let me explain what the columns are.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
So there's a name of the actor.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Total gross.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
That's not the amount of money that the actor makes.

48:46.000 --> 48:53.000
That's the total amount made by the movies that the actor was in.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
And that is in millions of dollars.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Then there's a number of movies that actor has been in.

49:00.000 --> 49:09.000
The average per movie is among that actor's movies, what was the average amount made by the movies?

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
And the number one movie is this actor was in a bunch of movies.

49:13.000 --> 49:18.000
One of them had the highest gross amount, which one was that, and that's there.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
And then I think it's, I think what did that one gross?

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
They're highest grossing movie.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
What did that one gross?

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
And so there were, there's a table with the 50 highest ones in about 2015.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
And you can see most of them are guys.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
There's a few women as well on the list.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Okay.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
So what I would like to do is I would like to draw a scatter diagram.

49:43.000 --> 49:49.000
What I'm going to look at is, well, we're going to take a look at this diagram.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
And then we're going to see exactly what it's doing.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
This is called a scatter. It is not a line plot on the horizontal axis.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
We're going to have number of movies.

49:59.000 --> 50:10.000
And on the vertical axis, we're going to have the total amount grossed by the movie.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
This is a scatter of points like a cloud.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
It's often called a cloud.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
Each point represents one actor.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
And it's basically like plotting points on an XY grid on the horizontal axis.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
You have number of movies.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
And on the vertical, you have the total amount grossed.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Okay. So who was the top here?

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
It was Harrison Ford.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
41 movies.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Top grossing was about there.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
So can we find Harrison Ford here?

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
41 top gross in this one.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Agreed.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Okay.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
I'd like you to take a look at that scatter.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
What that is showing is called positive association.

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
The more movies, in general, the more total amount of money.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Right? You can see that there is a trend.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
The two variables are associated.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
There is some relation between them.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
Association was the word that we had in our second lecture when we started out.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
This is positive association.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
No surprise.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
The more movies, the more total amount made.

51:09.000 --> 51:15.000
So what we're going to do now is we are going to look at a different scatter diagram.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
Number of movies versus the average amount made per movie.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
Again, every point is going to be an actor.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Ooh, very different.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Very different.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Negative association.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
So there's a point for every actor.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
And what you're seeing in this is that the more movies those actors made,

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
on average the less those movies made.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
So you can see the negative association.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
And there is one point that is just screaming at you.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
Yes?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
You see this?

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Screaming at you.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Shall we find out who that is?

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
Because this person is the boss of this diagram.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
Small number of movies and through the roof, average gross.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Okay.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
So tell me if that, you think that is a good call.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
Actors are where the average per movie above 400.

52:09.000 --> 52:18.000
Look good? Yes? All right.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Anthony Daniels.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Anthony Daniels.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
Don't look at me like who's Anthony Daniels.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
What do you mean?

52:26.000 --> 52:29.000
Anthony Daniels is the boss of this diagram.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Small number of movies.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
A ton of money per movie.

52:34.000 --> 52:40.000
All right.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
What is, whoa.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
What is the data science lesson?

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
Pay attention to what's being measured.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
You're not measuring what the actor makes.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
You're measuring what the movies make.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
This actor is only in the Star Wars franchise.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Every single one is a blockbuster.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
On average through the roof.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Okay.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
Guys, I want to say something about Friday.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
Friday people go through the following calculation.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
I've done my lab.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
It's Friday.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
I got other stuff.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I don't need to come.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Here's what I'm going to say.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
This particular Friday is on histograms.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
People make this calculation every term.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.000
And they look at it and go, that's a bar graph, I understand.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
We have found that this topic causes trouble on homeworks, labs,

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
and especially the midterm.

53:36.000 --> 54:03.000
Please show up.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
All right.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Thank you.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
All right.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Thank you.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Thank you.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Thank you.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
All right.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
All right.

54:54.000 --> 55:14.000
All right.
