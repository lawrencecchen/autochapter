WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
All right, okay, is this projecting at all?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.240
Can everyone hear me?

00:06.240 --> 00:07.720
Give me the back.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.080
We get, awesome.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.520
All right, so welcome everyone to the first lecture

00:11.520 --> 00:13.720
of CS61A.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.560
Yeah!

00:14.560 --> 00:19.560
APPLAUSE

00:19.560 --> 00:21.880
Wow, I'm so glad that got a response.

00:21.880 --> 00:28.320
So this is, I'm super glad to see this lecture in so full.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.480
So let's just go ahead and jump in to the first lecture.

00:32.480 --> 00:36.160
Before we talk about anything relating to computer science,

00:36.160 --> 00:38.560
first we're going to talk about 6.1A as a class,

00:38.560 --> 00:40.840
starting with the 6.1A community.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.920
So first of all, hi, my name's Chris.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.960
I'm going to be one of your instructors.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.480
My pronouns are they, them.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.720
And I've been teaching 6.1A for a while.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.320
I've been a TA for five semesters involved a bit before that.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.720
And this is my first time as an instructor for this course.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.200
So I'm really excited.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.040
Some might interest within computer science

01:02.040 --> 01:06.400
our computational biology and programming languages.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.200
So if you want to talk about that or really anything

01:08.200 --> 01:10.560
in the course, you can feel free to reach out.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.120
I'm going to go ahead and pass around this mic.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.160
There's going to be a little bit of like,

01:14.160 --> 01:15.760
some noise is going on.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.920
Let's see.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.880
Let's see.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.400
Yeah.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.600
My name's Debbie.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.720
This is, I'll be one of your other lecturers in the summer.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.440
This is my eight time teaching the course.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.760
So my first time lecture, in terms of computer science,

01:31.760 --> 01:33.440
my interest in computer security

01:33.440 --> 01:35.640
and a demo some research in agritorial and out.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.120
So if you find yourself interested in that later

01:38.120 --> 01:40.240
on the course, which we'll try to talk to me,

01:40.240 --> 01:41.800
also this is a really difficult course.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.120
So we're all here to talk to you about anything

01:44.120 --> 01:44.920
if you've ever needed.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.880
So free email on us, I think that's it.

01:47.880 --> 01:55.120
I'll be one of the other three instructors.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.760
My research interests are kind of probably

01:56.760 --> 01:59.080
language design, as well as the applications

01:59.080 --> 02:01.320
to CS education in particular.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.800
This is also taught it for a fair amount.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.760
Excited to be.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
Cool.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.120
All right, so I'll take this back.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.040
So if you ever want to contact us,

02:11.040 --> 02:16.560
you should email us at CS61A plus SU19 at Berkeley.edu.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.720
If you email us there, you'll be able to,

02:19.720 --> 02:20.960
all three of us will see that.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.280
So that's the best way to contact us.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.840
You can also reach out to us individually

02:24.840 --> 02:27.120
if you have something pertaining to one of us

02:27.120 --> 02:30.000
as individuals, but this is the email you should be

02:30.000 --> 02:31.680
looking at for the most part.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.880
So we're here in Struck.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.400
We're also here coming in.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.520
There's a lot of seats on this side.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.720
So it's so pretty to go in on the other entry.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.400
And those are like seats in experts.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.640
So maybe if you're in the middle area,

02:43.640 --> 02:45.040
we could like switch together a little bit,

02:45.040 --> 02:46.600
really just coming in.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.960
Yeah, there's a seat next to you,

02:47.960 --> 02:49.120
and you can move to the center.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.400
Let's do that so people coming in can do that.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.320
Awesome.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.760
I'll give like a minute for the noise to settle here.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.240
All right, so you've met us.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.880
We're going to be your instructors,

03:03.880 --> 03:05.600
but there's just three of us,

03:05.600 --> 03:08.560
and there's like 400 plus a view in this room.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.400
So there's no way we can do all this by ourselves,

03:11.400 --> 03:15.960
which is why we have a wonderful team of TAs,

03:15.960 --> 03:18.240
as well as tutors.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.360
So TAs are responsible for running lab and discussion sections.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.760
You'll see them in office hours.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.520
Tutors are responsible for running smaller group tutoring

03:28.520 --> 03:31.000
sections, which we'll talk about a little bit later.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.720
But both TAs and tutors are going to be the people you're

03:33.720 --> 03:38.080
going to be interacting with most often throughout the course.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.000
So with that in mind, we have a bunch of them

03:41.000 --> 03:42.760
up here on stage, so I'm going to go ahead

03:42.760 --> 03:46.200
and try to pass down the mic when you get it.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.400
If you can just give your name, your role.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you can come down here

03:52.600 --> 03:53.880
and pass it down, yeah.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.320
So I have like two cables tethering me down.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.680
It's a lot of fun.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.960
OK, I want to make TAs an Albert.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.240
I want to be part of the new grading,

04:06.240 --> 04:10.960
so I'll give you why as TAs, and then I'll also be doing

04:10.960 --> 04:12.920
a little bit of the T, that music's on the side,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.280
so maybe this is not a whole domain of TAs,

04:15.280 --> 04:17.800
but I've got to give you some money on my music,

04:17.800 --> 04:19.240
so it's an opportunity to talk about that,

04:19.240 --> 04:22.280
to give you the objective.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.840
Hello, I'm Richard.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.440
I took six to make last summer.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.920
I'm going to be a TAs this summer.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.680
I'm really excited to be teaching about it, so.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.440
And while I'm running on one of the other materials,

04:34.440 --> 04:39.000
and I do content for the projects.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.880
Hello, my name is Jason.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.960
I'm going to be TAs this summer,

04:42.960 --> 04:48.120
and you can feel free to come here in one second.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.200
Hi, I'm Olivia, I'm a TAs, and I think

04:51.200 --> 04:55.520
we're just a little bit more in.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.360
I'm also TAs, and I'm going to be working

04:57.360 --> 04:59.720
on the online content itself.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.080
Welcome.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.240
Hi, I'm Edo, and I'm a TAs.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.800
Hi, I'm Michelle, and welcome with Olivia,

05:08.800 --> 05:11.800
and I'm a little bit of just six.

05:11.800 --> 05:17.360
Hi, I'm Edo, and I'm TAs, and I'm TAs, and I'm TAs.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.360
Hi, I'm Jenny, first, and I'm from the classical century.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
Woo!

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
Woo!

05:23.360 --> 05:24.360
Thank you.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
Thank you.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.840
Thank you.

05:26.840 --> 05:31.800
All right, y'all can feel free to add back a little bit.

05:31.800 --> 05:46.640
All right, okay, so again, these tutors and TAs

05:46.640 --> 05:47.920
are going to be the people you're going to be

05:47.920 --> 05:50.360
interacting with the most throughout the semester.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.320
So once you start going to lab and discussion,

05:53.320 --> 05:55.280
these are the people that you should be sure to get to know,

05:55.280 --> 05:57.760
and they'll be the best people to handle

05:57.760 --> 06:00.800
most of your questions and concerns in this course.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.280
In addition to TAs and tutors, we also have a very, very

06:04.280 --> 06:06.160
large group of academic interns.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.040
Academic interns are students who usually recently

06:09.040 --> 06:11.960
took the class, and they'll be helping out in your lab

06:11.960 --> 06:16.240
and office hour sections to give you some help with the assignments.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.440
This is like a very small subset of the people we'll have

06:19.440 --> 06:22.360
helping out as AI's over the summer, so you'll

06:22.360 --> 06:24.760
be seeing a lot of those as well.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.440
And then, in addition to TAs, tutors, instructors,

06:29.440 --> 06:31.880
and academic interns, we have the most important people

06:31.880 --> 06:35.040
in this course, all of you.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.040
Yeah.

06:36.040 --> 06:42.000
APPLAUSE

06:42.000 --> 06:45.840
Very much not used to all this applause, but I don't know.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.160
Yeah, it comes with a job, I guess.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.520
So yeah, over the summer, this is by far the largest group

06:51.520 --> 06:53.520
of students we've ever had for summer course,

06:53.520 --> 06:57.280
across the in-person 61A and online 6.1A sections.

06:57.280 --> 07:01.240
We have over 650 people enrolled in this course.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.400
And all of us are really, really excited

07:04.400 --> 07:07.240
to be able to work with all of you and put on a great class

07:07.240 --> 07:08.840
semester.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.040
Really excited to be able to talk to you and work

07:11.040 --> 07:12.800
with you through all of this.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.240
So with that, let's start talking about 6.1A in particular.

07:17.240 --> 07:22.560
So 6.1A is a class in the computer science department.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.680
For many of you, it might be your first computer science class.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.560
So what is computer science?

07:29.560 --> 07:32.280
Computer science is a very broad field.

07:32.280 --> 07:37.160
But in general, computer science is the study

07:37.160 --> 07:41.240
of different problems that can be solved using computation.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.600
So all computation means is that you do some series of steps.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.440
Maybe you're doing some math or just following some instructions

07:48.440 --> 07:51.400
to be able to get some result.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.680
This doesn't even need to be done with computers.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.080
In fact, in the early days, if you just

07:57.080 --> 08:00.120
had someone write a bunch of math,

08:00.120 --> 08:04.360
you might even call them computers.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.480
But more specifically, computer science

08:06.480 --> 08:12.560
is how do you take these problems and solve the different approaches

08:12.560 --> 08:14.080
for being able to solve these problems?

08:14.080 --> 08:17.120
So there are a bunch of different ways

08:17.120 --> 08:18.280
you can approach different problems.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.400
A bunch of different ways you can solve them with computation.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.960
And computer science talks about some

08:23.960 --> 08:25.560
of those different approaches.

08:25.560 --> 08:29.680
In particular, we are interested in the techniques

08:29.680 --> 08:31.920
that lead to the most effective solutions.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.840
So of course, some solutions will take more time or require

08:35.840 --> 08:37.360
more resources than others.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.040
So we're interested in the solutions

08:39.040 --> 08:41.560
that are going to be the most effective.

08:44.760 --> 08:48.800
One other thing to note is that not all problems

08:48.800 --> 08:52.280
can be solved effectively through computation.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.720
For example, a lot of problems out there

08:54.720 --> 08:59.880
will require you to actually, I don't know, interact with people.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.080
And those tasks aren't very easily solved

09:03.080 --> 09:06.360
by just a list of steps you can blindly follow.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.200
So it's important to note that computer science

09:08.200 --> 09:10.440
doesn't tell you how to solve every problem.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.120
But there's a great variety of problems

09:12.120 --> 09:14.280
that it can solve.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.720
And we're interested in effective solutions

09:15.720 --> 09:17.080
for those problems.

09:17.080 --> 09:21.240
So what are some of these different problems that you can solve?

09:21.240 --> 09:24.040
So there's systems like operating systems,

09:24.040 --> 09:26.680
compilers, artificial intelligence, graphics,

09:26.680 --> 09:29.640
so on and so forth.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.880
There's a big long list.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.640
These are just a subset of the interests

09:32.640 --> 09:36.080
that people at Berkeley have as their research interests.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.400
But just about any of these topics,

09:38.400 --> 09:40.080
if you're interested in, you can ultimately

09:40.080 --> 09:42.720
take a class in at Berkeley or elsewhere.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.160
By the way, if you're sitting in the back,

09:44.160 --> 09:46.800
we still do have quite a few seats on this side of the room

09:46.800 --> 09:51.720
if you want to move over and not clog up the rows.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.800
So, are these ways probably exiting

09:54.800 --> 09:56.640
and then going through the other entry?

09:56.640 --> 09:57.840
There's another door on this side,

09:57.840 --> 10:00.040
so if you exit the ground.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.040
Of course.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.040
So that's computer science.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.600
What is 61A in particular about?

10:05.600 --> 10:08.160
Well, it's about managing complexity.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.840
So a lot of these problems can have really

10:10.840 --> 10:13.160
complicated and large solutions.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.680
And one important skill to be able to have

10:15.680 --> 10:18.760
is how to take these solutions and express them

10:18.760 --> 10:22.200
in a really simple and effective way.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.280
One of the ways we teach this in this course

10:24.280 --> 10:26.840
is through mastering abstraction.

10:26.840 --> 10:33.080
So what abstraction means is for most things you run across,

10:33.080 --> 10:36.080
you don't need to know exactly how they work.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.200
You can take some of the complicated details

10:39.200 --> 10:40.960
and, well, abstract them away.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.160
So for example, when you're interacting with other people,

10:44.160 --> 10:45.920
when you see human being, you don't see them

10:45.920 --> 10:49.600
as a collection of cells or a bunch of chemical processes

10:49.600 --> 10:53.080
happening, you interact with them as humans.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.100
So you abstract away all those chemical and biological

10:56.100 --> 11:00.240
processes and view them as a human.

11:00.240 --> 11:05.640
With programs, instead of looking at the very minute details

11:05.640 --> 11:08.800
of what's going on, we'll see different ways

11:08.800 --> 11:11.600
to group them and abstract them.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.720
One of those ways is by exposing you to different programming

11:14.720 --> 11:15.600
paradigms.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.520
So programming paradigms are just different ways

11:18.520 --> 11:21.320
to approach writing programs.

11:21.320 --> 11:25.000
And a lot of these have very general abstract differences.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.240
So across this course, we'll be exposing you

11:29.240 --> 11:33.320
to imperative, declarative, functional,

11:33.320 --> 11:35.000
several different types of programming.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.680
And these are different ways that you can organize your program

11:37.680 --> 11:40.680
and help manage its complexity.

11:40.680 --> 11:44.760
Of course, 61A, again, is many of your first computer science

11:44.760 --> 11:47.240
classes, so we also hope for it to serve

11:47.240 --> 11:49.880
as an introduction to program.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.160
So we'll hope that we can give you

11:52.160 --> 11:55.440
a pretty full understanding of Python fundamentals.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.720
After you go through this course, you

11:56.720 --> 12:01.120
should be able to do a lot in Python.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.320
We also take a lot of smaller ideas

12:04.320 --> 12:06.440
that will teach in lecture and discussion in lab

12:06.440 --> 12:09.040
and combine those into larger projects, which

12:09.040 --> 12:10.960
is an important skill to be able to have

12:10.960 --> 12:12.640
when you're in the real world, because most of what you're

12:12.640 --> 12:15.760
going to be doing is large projects.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.440
And finally, we'll talk a little bit

12:17.440 --> 12:20.960
about how computers interpret programming languages.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.640
So when you write code, how does your computer actually

12:24.640 --> 12:28.240
take that code and how is it able to run it?

12:28.240 --> 12:29.920
In the beginning of the course, we'll

12:29.920 --> 12:34.000
talk about this more mechanically.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.720
So we'll have you actually do some of the interpretation

12:36.720 --> 12:37.520
yourself.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.000
But later in the course, we'll talk about how computers

12:40.000 --> 12:44.280
can interpret programming languages automatically.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.800
And finally, this is a challenging course

12:46.800 --> 12:48.920
that will demand a lot for me.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.840
The pace of this course is very fast.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.320
There's going to be a lot of assignments.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.360
However, if you do choose to stick with this class,

12:57.360 --> 12:59.320
we have a lot of resources available,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.280
and we do really want you to succeed.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.760
So please don't understand the pace and difficulty

13:03.760 --> 13:06.320
of this class, but also understand

13:06.320 --> 13:09.720
that there's a lot of things available for you

13:09.720 --> 13:11.800
if you want to stick with this class.

13:11.800 --> 13:16.000
That being said, this class isn't the right first programming

13:16.000 --> 13:18.720
or computer science class for everyone.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.720
And with that in mind, there are a couple of alternatives

13:20.720 --> 13:23.480
to CS61A that you might want to keep in mind.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.280
So the first one is CS10, called the beauty and joy

13:27.280 --> 13:29.240
of computing.

13:29.240 --> 13:34.360
CS10 is designed for students who do not have prior experience.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.080
So even though in 61A, we try to make the course such

13:38.080 --> 13:39.720
that you can still succeed.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.040
Even if you don't have prior programming experience,

13:42.040 --> 13:43.480
I didn't have prior programming experience

13:43.480 --> 13:46.120
when I took the course, for example.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.760
However, CS10 is specifically designed

13:48.760 --> 13:50.200
for students without prior experience.

13:50.200 --> 13:54.560
So for some students, this is a better fit for your first class.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.520
This is an introduction to some of the fundamentals

13:57.520 --> 13:59.080
of computer science.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.560
It does go over some Python, although some of the class

14:01.560 --> 14:05.080
is also in a language called snap, which

14:05.080 --> 14:06.920
is more of a visual language.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.560
But after going through CS10, you'll

14:08.560 --> 14:11.680
know a lot of the concepts and Python fundamentals

14:11.680 --> 14:14.440
that you'll need for 61A.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.360
Right now, it has a shortest waitlist.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.720
And over the summer, it has been taught by Matthew and Monty.

14:21.720 --> 14:26.840
So you can see more info at cs10.org.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.880
There's also data eight, which is the foundations of data science.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.400
So data goes over the fundamentals of computing

14:34.400 --> 14:36.640
of statistical inference and some a little bit

14:36.640 --> 14:39.760
of machine learning applied to real world data sets.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.760
So the purpose of data eight is a little bit different

14:42.760 --> 14:44.480
than CS61A.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.680
CS61A is a class about computer science.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.200
Data eight is a class about data science,

14:50.200 --> 14:52.080
which is a little bit different because it's more concerned

14:52.080 --> 14:54.160
with how you process data, but there is still

14:54.160 --> 14:56.080
quite a bit of overlap.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.520
It does feature more statistics than computer science.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.520
However, the programming isn't 61A,

15:02.520 --> 15:06.640
so it is a good exposure to Python if you want to take that

15:06.640 --> 15:07.920
before 61A.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.920
If you want to enroll, it's listed as CSC8,

15:10.920 --> 15:14.440
although it's referred to as data eight.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.280
It has a little bit of a larger waitlist,

15:17.280 --> 15:21.000
but it is being taught over the summer by Natalia and Francie.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.760
It's actually the lecture right before this one.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.720
So you'll probably run to them as they're exiting the hall.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.280
All right.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.120
So more info on data eight.org.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.200
So I'm going to go ahead and hand it off to Tiffany

15:39.200 --> 15:41.240
to talk a little bit about the course logistics,

15:41.240 --> 15:45.680
again, pardon me, as there's a little bit of noise here.

15:45.680 --> 15:49.160
So we're trying to get screencasts for most of these lectures,

15:49.160 --> 15:51.440
which means we need both the mic to project

15:51.440 --> 15:52.480
and another mic to record.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.520
So it's a little bit of technical setup.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.480
We'll talk a bit about that in a minute.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.520
So I'm going to talk a bit about course format

15:58.520 --> 16:01.880
and concretely just, so first off,

16:01.880 --> 16:04.240
this course has a lot of different components.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.720
I'll just do the thing right now.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.600
There's a lecture that'll be every Monday

16:07.600 --> 16:10.640
through Thursday at 11 a.m. in this room.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.120
Lecture is where you're going to be exposed

16:12.120 --> 16:14.080
to course material for the first time.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.160
So we strongly encourage you to come in person.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.160
So you see the lecture before your discussion,

16:18.160 --> 16:20.000
because generally, although your change

16:20.000 --> 16:23.760
is very kind, it will be we need discussions most effective

16:23.760 --> 16:25.720
if you've seen the relevant lecture beforehand.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.960
There's also a lab, discussion and office analysis.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.640
The reason that these are all labeled

16:31.640 --> 16:33.000
the most important part of the course

16:33.000 --> 16:35.080
is because it really depends on the student

16:35.080 --> 16:37.120
and we encourage you to both.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.920
You should really complete all of them,

16:38.920 --> 16:40.520
and you'll see that probably one of them

16:40.520 --> 16:42.400
will be the most effective for your learning.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.200
The lab is the place where you'll usually,

16:46.200 --> 16:47.680
after lecture before discussion,

16:47.680 --> 16:50.120
you're going to actually interact with your machine

16:50.120 --> 16:52.280
to do some programming in the soda labs.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.240
This is where you'll get to interact with a lot of concepts

16:54.240 --> 16:56.280
for the first time in discussion.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.800
You're going to actually be working on pen and paper.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.600
And you may be wondering, why do we do that?

17:00.600 --> 17:04.200
This is because this course is actually quite theoretical.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.240
This isn't a programming course.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.120
You will learn programming over the course of the course,

17:09.120 --> 17:12.120
but that was not meant to be like a hot rhyme.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.320
That isn't the focus.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.880
The focus is giving you a foundation and computer science.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.880
And that's why discussion where you go over questions

17:19.880 --> 17:23.360
with a pen and paper is a really fundamental part of the course

17:23.360 --> 17:26.880
and happens after a lab once you've got your fundamentals down.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.600
All this hours are where you can drop by to ask any questions.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.920
Oftentimes, we'll come with a side of questions

17:31.920 --> 17:34.000
because the assignments are very challenging.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.600
This is where you'll interact with a lot of the active

17:35.600 --> 17:37.760
in the interns as well.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.680
And then, we also have an online textbook.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.320
Some students read this textbook,

17:42.320 --> 17:43.640
and the chapter is associated.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.960
You'll feed on the website.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.760
Every lecture has associated text and chapters.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.800
Some students read this before lecture.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.720
Some students read this after lecture.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.920
Some students don't read this textbook at all.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.760
I don't know about the key here, how much of the text works.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.720
But we highly encourage you for a use of first

17:59.720 --> 18:01.720
D to read the text book and see what you're

18:01.720 --> 18:02.800
trying to help for.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.840
Personally, a lot of the text books.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.800
And I think, because now it's going to read the text book,

18:08.800 --> 18:09.600
because it's not a color.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.040
I'm not trying to say both are normal and acceptable.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.960
But ultimately, it just depends on what your learning style is.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.800
So try it out and see what works for you.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.960
And there's also weekly homework assignments

18:22.960 --> 18:26.120
for big program projects, a midterm and a final.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.240
And the reason we're listing all this

18:27.240 --> 18:29.240
is to say, it will be very demanding.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.520
And this is what you can expect.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.480
But there also will be a lot of support along the way.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.880
Any questions?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.440
Yeah, in the front.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.080
So the program is going to be able to program the project

18:41.080 --> 18:42.440
all the time.

18:42.440 --> 18:42.920
Yes.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.960
Holly, you put it in the program you project.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.240
You wouldn't believe the point is.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.320
But you're like, yeah, so there are four projects.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.000
There are a lot of means about them online.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.640
And soon, you'll be able to relate to those movies.

18:54.640 --> 18:58.280
So in terms of the first week, you just logistics.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.560
Lab will start in Wednesday.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.360
So even if you have a Monday or Tuesday

19:01.360 --> 19:04.440
lab not happening this week, because that's just set up.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.440
Do the lab on your own.

19:05.440 --> 19:05.960
Stop it all.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.720
The stars if you need help, but set up.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.560
Just one quick announcement about Lab Zero.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.240
On Piazza, some of you were mentioning

19:13.240 --> 19:16.560
that you were running into some issues with Lab Zero.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.400
I think we found that some students running in Map OS

19:20.400 --> 19:22.120
are able to run Lab Zero.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.880
So we're working on fixing that.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.800
So this is not working for you.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.360
We'll let you know when you can read download it,

19:27.360 --> 19:28.760
and it should be fixed.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.920
This is an example of debugging on the spot.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.360
There'll be a left-shandered bug you see.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.760
But yeah, we'll have a fix up shortly,

19:36.760 --> 19:39.240
and you should keep an eye on Piazza.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.640
In terms of discussion, discussions start on Tuesday.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.200
And we highly encourage you to attend the discussion

19:44.200 --> 19:47.040
of matches your lab.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.440
You can see on the base in your discussion number,

19:49.440 --> 19:51.280
you can see whether they've mapped your lab.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.200
They should have the same pattern.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.120
The reason for this is so that you see the same Pia,

19:56.120 --> 19:57.200
and they get to know you, and they'll

19:57.200 --> 19:59.200
be able to help you much more effectively.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.800
It's also better organizationally for hours.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.080
And finally, office hours will also start on Tuesday.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.640
There are no office hours today.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.640
OK, so in terms of attendance,

20:09.640 --> 20:12.080
we do not select luxury tenants at all.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.120
But as I said, you highly encourage you to attend.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.320
This is our first time trying to webcast the summer session.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.720
So we'll try to make it as involved as you can,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.160
but there are no promises around that.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.840
This is kind of an experience.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.760
So you can come in person without quality bets.

20:26.760 --> 20:30.560
And historically, if you fall behind in terms of lecture,

20:30.560 --> 20:33.400
which is what often happens with students don't come to lecture,

20:33.400 --> 20:35.440
the other parts of the course is snowball

20:35.440 --> 20:37.040
and become a lot more difficult.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.960
So it really encourage you to come with your tenant.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.320
Discussion and lab attendance aren't tracked,

20:42.320 --> 20:44.720
and we're going to talk about what that counts for in a bit.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.320
It doesn't directly count for your grades,

20:46.320 --> 20:49.400
but it counts for something called participation points.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.520
And then finally, all your assignments, labs,

20:52.520 --> 20:55.520
home rates, projects can be submitted remotely.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.520
So if you happen to be out of Berkeley for some reason,

20:57.520 --> 21:00.000
or you have an emergency, as long as you look computer on you,

21:00.000 --> 21:00.800
you should be fine.

21:04.440 --> 21:07.360
OK, so as you mentioned earlier, with some of your tutors,

21:07.360 --> 21:09.640
we also offer a small room tutoring section,

21:09.640 --> 21:12.560
which are led by the staff that we saw earlier.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.760
Local structures are around four of these people,

21:14.760 --> 21:16.680
and it's just to be a more intimate environment

21:16.680 --> 21:17.880
to review the material.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.960
But these are from the optional, and there

21:19.960 --> 21:21.600
are limited number of spots.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.520
So around the end of this week, we'll have sign-ups.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.360
And to make it more clear, the purpose of these sections

21:27.360 --> 21:29.440
are, if in discussion, you feel like you

21:29.440 --> 21:32.280
aren't getting enough review, and you would like more practice,

21:32.280 --> 21:34.320
you can sign up for one of these tutoring sections,

21:34.320 --> 21:37.160
you'll get more practice with supplemental material,

21:37.160 --> 21:40.400
and a small environment, so maybe you can ask more questions

21:40.400 --> 21:42.280
and feel more comfortable.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.880
Those sign-ups will be up on this.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.240
And in this week, I'm Piazza.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.280
Also, we have something called conceptual office hours.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.640
So I do think it all upstairs is a good session

21:52.640 --> 21:53.920
in my training work.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.760
But unfortunately, you're on a side of usually

21:55.760 --> 21:58.520
that cloned with just to make a sign-up question

21:58.520 --> 22:00.480
and debugging help, which is also useful,

22:00.480 --> 22:03.840
but usually doesn't get to the core of the material,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.560
the key constants that may test on your exams,

22:06.560 --> 22:07.720
for example.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.920
So conceptual office hours are a place that

22:09.920 --> 22:12.680
are specifically reserved for no assignment help

22:12.680 --> 22:14.560
and only conceptual questions.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.040
So these will be out into the calendar scene,

22:17.040 --> 22:19.280
and you can expect to go there for that type of help.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.000
So girl is such a piece.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.440
Historically, in this course, a combination

22:27.440 --> 22:31.040
is because people can continue collecting every single day

22:31.040 --> 22:33.000
and it's kind of a great decade.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.440
It was student falls behind to whatever reason.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.320
There's a great opportunity to catch

22:37.320 --> 22:40.120
back up on materials that just pass, right?

22:40.120 --> 22:42.480
Because we just keep going with new content.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.080
Real sections are kind of meant to go this gap

22:45.080 --> 22:47.120
because they'll be once a week.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.720
They go from zero to a hundred of that little material

22:49.720 --> 22:51.800
to a scaffolding worksheet.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.960
Essentially, with a formatting, they'll go to this room

22:53.960 --> 22:54.960
with a bunch of mixed units,

22:54.960 --> 22:57.280
working to get some on the view on depth

22:57.280 --> 22:58.200
as this is a big topic.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.680
So it's doing it from cheering sections

22:59.680 --> 23:00.600
and that you don't sign up.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.720
They're going to be dropping.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.680
You can go to one, you can go to all of them.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.400
And at the bill section, you'll be in groups

23:06.400 --> 23:07.920
and work through this gap with a worksheet

23:07.920 --> 23:09.560
and hopefully by the end,

23:09.560 --> 23:11.360
feel much more comfortable with those topics

23:11.360 --> 23:13.800
that you might have missed earlier in the week.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.240
Does that make sense to be ready?

23:15.240 --> 23:17.920
Or any questions that I think I went through so far?

23:19.440 --> 23:20.280
Yeah, that's fine.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.800
Is the left task going to be real?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.960
So I'm not going to go to the court as opposed to that.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.520
For a court and a post it, Alex and Chris know more about it.

23:26.520 --> 23:29.760
Yeah, so we're like, the reason we have so many microphones

23:29.760 --> 23:31.760
is because we're recording it right now.

23:31.760 --> 23:35.680
But to note, there's no guarantees on one

23:35.680 --> 23:37.080
that screencast will go up.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.640
It might be that evening, it might be a day or two later.

23:39.640 --> 23:43.480
So that's, it's meant to help you review the lectures

23:43.480 --> 23:45.640
if you missed something in live lecture,

23:45.640 --> 23:47.840
but it's not meant to be a consistent replacement

23:47.840 --> 23:48.680
for live lecture.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.000
Cool.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.440
Any other questions?

23:52.440 --> 23:53.280
Yeah.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.360
What answer?

23:54.360 --> 23:55.200
Yeah.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.040
We're going to be every Friday at 11 a.m.

23:57.040 --> 23:58.040
So we have lecture, money,

23:58.040 --> 24:01.520
you're freezing, real protection, but Friday, I think

24:01.520 --> 24:03.000
it's still in the book or room,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.200
but we'll have those details on the website too.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.320
It won't start this week.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.280
It will start like in the future.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.360
Yeah, don't we know the real section this week?

24:10.360 --> 24:11.600
They start second week.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.240
Okay.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.280
Are you missing at home?

24:16.280 --> 24:17.120
Yes.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.120
In the front.

24:18.120 --> 24:18.960
Oh.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.160
I mean,

24:20.160 --> 24:21.800
it's going to look more and more carefully

24:21.800 --> 24:23.280
to take the stage around it,

24:23.280 --> 24:24.480
but more more more more.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.000
They may change right.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.400
Oh, yes, it turns from the fire, of course,

24:28.400 --> 24:29.120
to the hands,

24:29.120 --> 24:31.920
but I don't know if it's the one hand to the one

24:31.920 --> 24:33.760
that won't be done at 18.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.600
Yeah.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.440
So the question was,

24:35.440 --> 24:36.400
do the homework to change?

24:36.400 --> 24:38.040
So the function has to be where it is.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.840
We also do know if the project will change

24:39.840 --> 24:41.600
by the way, doesn't look enough.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.880
The homework will be so much different

24:43.880 --> 24:45.520
because we're going in a different case,

24:45.520 --> 24:46.840
the numbers will map,

24:46.840 --> 24:49.800
but quite a few of the problems are shared.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.160
I hope this has been getting at like,

24:51.160 --> 24:52.760
ask your friends to introduce them up to you,

24:52.760 --> 24:53.600
do you think?

24:53.600 --> 24:54.440
You not do that.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.760
Those are a lot of things,

24:55.760 --> 24:58.040
but yeah, some of the homework problems

24:58.040 --> 24:59.520
are similar to the past and that.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.080
All right.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.440
There's one more question.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.280
Yeah.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.960
So the realizations are 11 a.m. on Friday, two, what time?

25:07.960 --> 25:09.960
11 1 p.m. on Friday.

25:09.960 --> 25:10.800
Yeah.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.640
Okay.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.200
And we have more details up on Kiazza

25:13.200 --> 25:14.200
once you have the room book

25:14.200 --> 25:16.040
and one deception that for half of it.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.520
Yeah.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.280
Oh, can we come like half way?

25:22.040 --> 25:22.880
Yeah.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.480
So you're,

25:24.480 --> 25:26.760
you're free to come half way, no one will stop you.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.480
But it might, because we try to keep the group's pace,

25:30.480 --> 25:31.920
it'll be a little bit harder,

25:33.240 --> 25:34.640
possibly, but you're free to come,

25:34.640 --> 25:38.440
just have that in mind that it'll be a little bit more

25:38.440 --> 25:40.480
difficult to keep up and become half way.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.840
Cool.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.920
So let's go a little bit into disagreeing breakdown.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.160
This is a graph of how your points are distributed.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.440
There's more details on the website.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
I don't want to get to it in the new shazits.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.120
Just to note, 140 of your points are from the exams,

25:55.120 --> 25:56.800
which we'll talk about in a bit,

25:56.800 --> 25:58.760
and 150 of your points within the budget.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.720
So it was a really the both of your points.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.920
So it made you put the decision points earlier

26:06.920 --> 26:08.960
from discussion and lab attendance,

26:08.960 --> 26:11.160
participation points as you would have noticed

26:11.160 --> 26:14.840
in that three graph, not here.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.400
The reason for that is because they don't

26:16.400 --> 26:18.760
explicitly count towards your final grade.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.360
If you don't want to participate,

26:20.360 --> 26:24.040
you could not participate in any lab discussion.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.280
However, we don't really encourage that.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.760
So if you're putting in effort,

26:28.760 --> 26:30.760
if you go to every lab and every discussion,

26:30.760 --> 26:34.320
if you happen to do below 50% of your exam,

26:34.320 --> 26:37.040
your attendance and your participation points

26:37.040 --> 26:40.000
will help you get closer to 50%.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.840
So if you do above 50%, it won't help you at all.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.640
If you do below 50%, it'll help you at closer.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.120
The specific or mill we use for toppling this

26:48.120 --> 26:50.440
is on the website, you can like 10,000 numbers

26:50.440 --> 26:52.040
see the precise number of discussions

26:52.040 --> 26:54.040
you want to go to, but ultimately,

26:54.040 --> 26:57.040
I encourage you to just go to your discussions and labs.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.760
The point of this is to give the credit

26:58.760 --> 27:01.480
the people who are really trying the best in the course.

27:01.480 --> 27:03.520
And for some reason, don't go to the exam,

27:03.520 --> 27:05.440
but you will let everything out.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.720
That'll make sense.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.560
Any questions?

27:07.560 --> 27:09.560
Does that make this patient?

27:09.560 --> 27:10.400
Yeah.

27:10.400 --> 27:14.200
Can you tell me if you're going to the school

27:14.200 --> 27:15.520
or are you especially going to the lab

27:15.520 --> 27:17.840
that we are involved in?

27:17.840 --> 27:20.800
Yeah, you can get the patient credit going

27:20.800 --> 27:25.040
to a different section, but for the first two weeks,

27:25.040 --> 27:27.240
please try to put this section here in Golden,

27:27.240 --> 27:30.000
just because we'll all be quite happy.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.520
To be clear, the discussion section here in Golden

27:32.520 --> 27:35.280
and the lab section that matches with that discussion section.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.120
Yes.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.200
Am I missing any?

27:42.600 --> 27:43.440
Okay.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.000
All right.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.480
So another thing I'm reading,

27:47.480 --> 27:48.920
there's going to be quite a bit of a new shift

27:48.920 --> 27:50.280
for a next slide, five slides.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.960
We're almost there.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.640
Homer 3D is done because after.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.600
What this means is that you don't be distressed

27:57.600 --> 28:00.320
about getting the entire homework fully threatened,

28:00.320 --> 28:02.000
especially some of the homework from this class

28:02.000 --> 28:03.040
will be very challenging.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.480
And we don't want you, that's your head.

28:05.480 --> 28:08.560
If you're too bored because you can't get one or two problems.

28:08.560 --> 28:10.800
Instead of how we do homework 3D is,

28:10.800 --> 28:15.720
if you get the majority of the problems correct,

28:15.720 --> 28:19.960
and we see some evidence of effort for the rest of the problems

28:19.960 --> 28:23.960
I mean, you wrote a program, we have other metrics

28:23.960 --> 28:26.480
for measuring whether you tried on our end,

28:26.480 --> 28:31.120
but for your purposes, this means Google attempts

28:31.120 --> 28:33.640
and all the problems getting most of them correct.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.240
If you do this, you will get credit

28:36.240 --> 28:38.440
for your homework assignments.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.120
This means basically the point of this is knowing

28:41.120 --> 28:44.680
you to be pressured to teach or look your friend's solution

28:44.680 --> 28:47.520
at anything like that, because if you put in your effort,

28:47.520 --> 28:49.320
keep up in the material, you should be able to get both

28:49.320 --> 28:51.760
in on the homework just by trying on your problems

28:51.760 --> 28:54.120
and getting most of them correct.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.720
Any questions on this because I know

28:55.720 --> 28:57.360
this might be able to confuse you?

29:00.120 --> 29:02.840
Okay, other, yeah, in the front.

29:02.840 --> 29:06.680
Or some of them are more than two lines of homework

29:06.680 --> 29:10.320
so all of them come out of the network.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.160
Yeah.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.000
So we've got to be in the front,

29:16.000 --> 29:18.320
some of the homework and a few lines of code,

29:18.320 --> 29:20.480
only a few lines of code, how do you measure effort?

29:20.480 --> 29:21.840
That's really good question.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.240
So effort is definitely not writing a wall

29:25.240 --> 29:26.520
and it's program possible.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.000
That's not how programming works.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.840
That's what it could mean.

29:29.840 --> 29:32.000
We have evidence of all your methods.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.960
So the reason I give you details is because this one

29:34.960 --> 29:36.960
should be easy when you're trying to name the system

29:36.960 --> 29:38.120
and that's not what we want.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.560
The reason we don't be creative corrected

29:39.560 --> 29:41.520
is trying to make it as easy and possible,

29:41.520 --> 29:44.040
but just to give some transparency,

29:44.040 --> 29:48.320
we have kind of our whole history of your homework.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.280
We've seen when you started,

29:49.280 --> 29:51.080
you see how many times you tried,

29:51.080 --> 29:52.320
there's a lot of data there.

29:52.320 --> 29:57.320
So we know, yeah, I hope that kind of answers the question.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.840
But if I give you like a black threshold,

29:59.840 --> 30:02.120
then you could all just, I don't know,

30:02.120 --> 30:04.280
try making five submissions and then we're done with it

30:04.280 --> 30:05.800
and that's not really the point.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.400
I don't even know what to do with it,

30:08.400 --> 30:09.240
but yeah.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.600
I don't know what to do with it as you go through it

30:10.600 --> 30:12.440
as well as the fact that what I don't do

30:12.440 --> 30:14.440
are asking for asking to do it for us.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.280
Yeah.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.120
Oh, okay.

30:16.120 --> 30:16.960
Good question.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.000
So you won't know what you're correct.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.240
That's a big deal.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.560
All the homework's from autofrainers,

30:20.560 --> 30:21.840
so you'll know what you're correct

30:21.840 --> 30:23.560
as soon as you found the correct question.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.040
In the front.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.320
I don't think that seeing programming is good

30:27.320 --> 30:29.120
to do around that first end,

30:29.120 --> 30:31.160
you have to correct me as you do,

30:31.160 --> 30:32.960
get out of the right answer, right?

30:32.960 --> 30:35.280
Yeah, I'm correct, I'm correct.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.120
I'm correct.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.640
So you get a 100 and a 10.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.120
If you read the about page,

30:41.120 --> 30:42.880
we go more in depth into this.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.560
It's kind of hard to explain in person,

30:44.560 --> 30:45.600
so you should read that first

30:45.600 --> 30:46.720
and then there are any questions.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.040
Essentially, we'd be like to extract away

30:50.040 --> 30:52.960
how the effort creating works to kind of open earlier,

30:52.960 --> 30:55.360
but just trust that happens that the point is,

30:55.360 --> 30:57.480
don't stress about getting all the problems correct,

30:57.480 --> 31:00.560
but try all of them, get most of them correct.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.400
All right.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.640
So, you guys are seeing uncorrected and composition,

31:03.640 --> 31:05.360
but you will get project partners.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.240
So hopefully that lightens below in a bit.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.160
Where you tell us that here,

31:09.160 --> 31:11.840
and keep in mind that projects are pretty big,

31:11.840 --> 31:14.080
it's the start one there, it actually posted.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.080
Please don't put them off for the last minute.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.280
Labs are also bringing on confusion,

31:19.280 --> 31:20.840
but you get two labs jobs.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.060
So we encourage you to put in your best effort.

31:25.880 --> 31:26.980
We are gonna double check something.

31:26.980 --> 31:28.520
Labs are great uncorrected, is right?

31:28.520 --> 31:29.360
Yeah, yeah.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.680
Okay.

31:30.680 --> 31:31.520
Yes.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.840
So, I've got the view both correct measurements,

31:33.840 --> 31:34.680
but yeah.

31:34.680 --> 31:38.400
So, we encourage you to complete all the labs

31:38.400 --> 31:39.240
and try to finish,

31:39.240 --> 31:40.480
and there are many to be assignments

31:40.480 --> 31:43.080
that you can finish in the lab fully correct.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.080
But if you end up having an off day,

31:45.080 --> 31:48.600
you get one or two, not at 100%, it's okay.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.640
You get two labs job.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.520
More details, you have this website.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.360
Okay.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.200
So also we have slip days.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.960
There are a lot of ways you try to introduce

31:57.960 --> 32:02.160
community in the course, one is your one 24 hour slip day.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.920
So this can be used on homework and projects.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.520
We have, you know, final deadline,

32:06.520 --> 32:08.040
officially on the course website,

32:08.040 --> 32:11.320
let's say you have some emergency situation,

32:11.320 --> 32:12.680
then you can use your slip day,

32:12.680 --> 32:15.240
and submit a day later,

32:15.240 --> 32:18.720
and you'll still get full credit.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.520
But you can only do this one for this semester.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.200
One thing to note is that,

32:22.200 --> 32:23.960
let's say you have a project partner,

32:23.960 --> 32:25.720
you use your slip hand off,

32:25.720 --> 32:27.440
and then you partner up for dance,

32:27.440 --> 32:29.280
which is on project three.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.240
They have a slip day, but you don't.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.320
If you both submit together a day later,

32:33.320 --> 32:35.840
you're gonna get the late penalty, but they won't.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.400
So that's an important thing to note.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.760
Slip days are individual,

32:39.760 --> 32:42.720
they can't be shared or gifted.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.080
We don't agree, so sort of great economy in this class.

32:47.080 --> 32:47.920
Okay.

32:49.360 --> 32:53.360
And it's finally, these are the two of your exams.

32:53.360 --> 32:56.520
Please make sure that your schedules are cleared.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.040
Unless you have another class

32:58.040 --> 32:59.960
with a directing van conflict,

32:59.960 --> 33:01.800
we cannot offer an alternate.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.320
So there will be a post for,

33:04.320 --> 33:07.400
if you do have a class with a direct conflict,

33:07.400 --> 33:08.600
how you can request an alternate,

33:08.600 --> 33:10.280
that information will all be on Piazza,

33:10.280 --> 33:13.480
but otherwise, please note the exam times.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.240
Unless you have another class,

33:16.240 --> 33:17.640
we cannot make exceptions.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
All right, and now, let's just talk a little bit

33:24.000 --> 33:26.280
about preparing for these exams

33:26.280 --> 33:28.000
that feel like I've been deciding a lot of fear

33:28.000 --> 33:30.840
about for the past, like 20 minutes,

33:30.840 --> 33:34.280
because I just want to make it clear

33:34.280 --> 33:37.120
that these exams are meant to be some sort of year.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.160
They're not meant to be able to be scared.

33:39.160 --> 33:42.000
The purpose of these exams are kind of like I mentioned earlier,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.120
just is quite a few rental courts.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.520
And the other types of the courts

33:45.520 --> 33:46.800
tend to be a bit more practical,

33:46.800 --> 33:49.000
especially your labs and your homework.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
But in exams, to get asking questions

33:51.000 --> 33:54.200
that get more to the core of specific concepts,

33:54.200 --> 33:57.000
for example, share a person with a mental leader,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.640
choose, I don't know how I'm only thinking

33:58.640 --> 34:01.160
about you later, really, really in danger now,

34:01.160 --> 34:03.320
but those are two big topics.

34:03.320 --> 34:05.080
These are big concepts.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.720
Sometimes when we don't enter them,

34:06.720 --> 34:09.760
we have to ask, create a couple examples,

34:09.760 --> 34:11.240
really get a sense of where you are

34:11.240 --> 34:12.760
and showing your understanding.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.840
So how do you say it's a new exam?

34:15.960 --> 34:18.380
Generally, I think kind of this is a back down

34:18.380 --> 34:19.680
for life courts and courts.

34:20.720 --> 34:23.000
And this isn't maybe what worked for everybody,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.080
but I want to give you my background.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.080
And maybe the last one of you

34:26.080 --> 34:27.200
to also explain how you did it,

34:27.200 --> 34:28.600
just to give you perspectives.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.800
For me, usually, at the end of the first week,

34:32.800 --> 34:34.680
I decided to push a lot to classes.

34:34.680 --> 34:37.240
I would look at one of the first exams

34:37.240 --> 34:41.280
from maybe the past year or all of our exams

34:41.280 --> 34:43.680
are posted on the resources page as soon as.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.000
You can access them there and take a look.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.400
What I'm trying to say is I would look at that exam

34:48.400 --> 34:52.600
and then it'll look like complete gibberish community, right?

34:52.600 --> 34:54.000
If I want to be able to identify

34:54.000 --> 34:56.440
what are the terms that come up the most often?

34:56.440 --> 34:58.880
What are the types of problems that come up on this exam?

34:58.880 --> 35:01.760
And then later on, in lecture, in discussion, in lab.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.240
But when I see that term again,

35:03.240 --> 35:04.680
when I see that there's a problem,

35:04.680 --> 35:06.160
I notice a super important.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.080
And I also know the levels of importance.

35:08.080 --> 35:11.040
And so once I've seen a couple of those problems,

35:11.040 --> 35:14.680
I do like to now go back and try out those past exam problems.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.160
Because I've seen them before and now you know

35:16.160 --> 35:19.720
of a learn the material when they got to that part of the course.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.840
What I'm trying to get at is just one approach.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.080
Some people don't like this because if it's world exam,

35:24.080 --> 35:25.960
in my experience, I don't remember

35:25.960 --> 35:27.480
and then I looked at me once,

35:27.480 --> 35:29.280
so it feels well for me.

35:29.280 --> 35:33.720
But what I'm trying to get at is not putting off exam settings

35:33.720 --> 35:36.680
to be told because that'll make it a lot more stressful.

35:36.680 --> 35:40.640
If you try to pack an exam problem every week,

35:40.640 --> 35:43.000
at the end of the week or the end of the fall week

35:43.000 --> 35:45.120
after went through that material,

35:45.120 --> 35:46.720
you'll find that it's a lot easier

35:46.720 --> 35:49.200
to figure out how to approach them and master them

35:49.200 --> 35:51.240
and create strategies to tackle them.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.320
I also really urge you to talk to your staff

35:53.320 --> 35:55.480
about this, the TA's, because they'll have

35:55.480 --> 35:57.640
the experience of them being able to relate to you

35:57.640 --> 35:59.600
more closely and you don't experience it.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.440
I guess one of the things I'll mention

36:04.440 --> 36:05.960
is that all the resources page,

36:05.960 --> 36:07.840
as we get further into the course,

36:07.840 --> 36:11.880
for every topic will have specific lists

36:11.880 --> 36:14.680
of the past exam problems from that topic.

36:14.680 --> 36:15.800
So that's another way to study.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.080
You can go through, all right,

36:17.080 --> 36:19.360
we just went through higher functions.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.480
We'll leave on the resources page

36:20.480 --> 36:23.040
and try the past exam problems or higher responses.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.600
Yeah.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.000
Alex also made this helpful flowchart.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.640
So, what he is trying to believe here

36:30.640 --> 36:33.360
is that you can start out with going to lecture

36:33.360 --> 36:35.320
and then you can catch up with him, you can prefer that.

36:35.320 --> 36:39.400
Then you go to lab, do some homework, go to discussion.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.960
After that, he's no post-shaking on a concept.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.640
That's what really sectioned it for.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.800
Also tuning sections that you like.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.040
And then after you have a foundation,

36:48.040 --> 36:49.320
you should be ready to tell me

36:49.320 --> 36:51.040
how those are naturally advanced.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.400
It won't be difficult,

36:52.400 --> 36:54.040
but the point of that little tooth

36:54.040 --> 36:55.880
is that you do it over and over again.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.520
I don't even know if you'd lecture in your test,

36:57.520 --> 37:01.040
but I really want to encourage you to start early

37:01.040 --> 37:03.280
and I think that'll really improve your experience.

37:04.760 --> 37:05.600
Cool.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.440
Any questions on the exams or the resources we have for that?

37:10.560 --> 37:11.400
Yeah, you know?

37:11.400 --> 37:13.240
We saw people asking about it.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.080
Yes.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.120
So, in here, there's no hours without,

37:17.120 --> 37:18.960
you know, people preparing for exams work.

37:18.960 --> 37:19.840
That's a good point.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.000
So conceptual officers are,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.600
they're kind of mentioned as purpose.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.720
You go to conceptual office hours with past exam problems

37:26.720 --> 37:28.560
and we're looking forward to helping you there.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.400
You know what's good,

37:29.400 --> 37:30.240
right?

37:30.240 --> 37:30.920
They're office hours for sure.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.080
You're free to do that as well.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.520
Like a sexual or kind of specialized for this.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.240
So yes, definitely a component.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.360
Any other questions?

37:41.440 --> 37:42.980
Cool.

37:42.980 --> 37:45.200
I'm almost tired of these logistics.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.520
I think this is the last slide.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.360
Okay.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.720
So just some stuff, an academic honesty

37:49.720 --> 37:51.720
or put nicely collaboration.

37:51.720 --> 37:55.400
So, this class is not clear.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.640
They're acceptance.

37:56.640 --> 38:01.280
This means that whether the 10 people next to you fail

38:01.280 --> 38:04.600
because you, but I'm not going to admit to a scenario.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.760
No one would happen to a student.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.600
It's not going to change the green that you get.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.840
So there's no incentive to do so, please.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.800
So, instead, what you really want to call through this class

38:14.800 --> 38:17.440
is an environment of collaboration, helping,

38:17.440 --> 38:18.560
and sharing with one another.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.080
We highly bridging work together

38:20.080 --> 38:21.720
because really for me,

38:21.720 --> 38:23.560
that's how we look at this class.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.080
So my best friend was 16 one day.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.080
Wow, it's used right here.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.280
And that's really the point of this operation.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.920
Policy, but there are limits.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.640
One, you cannot share code as anyone else in the courts

38:34.640 --> 38:36.160
except for your project partner

38:36.160 --> 38:38.320
on a project that you're working together on.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.320
The only circumstance, yeah,

38:41.320 --> 38:42.640
where you can look at someone else's code

38:42.640 --> 38:43.600
is what your partner is.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.480
So, sharing code with you the means,

38:46.480 --> 38:48.800
if you're sitting together in your dorm

38:48.800 --> 38:50.960
and you look at someone else's dreams

38:50.960 --> 38:53.800
and you want to help them, that's still sharing code.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.480
And it's explicitly not allowed.

38:55.480 --> 38:57.080
We've run into what businesses or people say

38:57.080 --> 38:57.920
that's all they're doing

38:57.920 --> 39:00.120
and that's how they ended up with exact copies.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.680
And even if you go to 10 this such,

39:01.680 --> 39:04.480
it often happens inadvertently when you're programming.

39:04.480 --> 39:07.880
So, please do not look at anyone else's code.

39:07.880 --> 39:10.520
We also have software for detecting this,

39:10.520 --> 39:12.640
and we will find out what's likely to do it.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.560
So, that's just a warning.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.920
Sorry to get to your software.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.000
Okay, so, if you wanted to just read anything I just said,

39:21.000 --> 39:22.400
it's all on the website.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.960
Chris, you're a very detailed documentation,

39:26.320 --> 39:28.520
and now you can talk to Alex.

39:28.520 --> 39:30.000
Okay, so now we're going to dive into

39:30.000 --> 39:32.040
the content of the course.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.600
The first thing we're talking about is expressions.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.360
So, what are expressions?

39:36.360 --> 39:38.320
So, expression describes a computation

39:38.320 --> 39:39.840
and evaluates to a value.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.160
So, this is some way we can kind of symbolically

39:42.160 --> 39:45.120
represent or programmatically represent some sort of

39:45.120 --> 39:47.800
computation that we're going to be doing.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.320
The field of mathematics has done this for a really long time.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.320
They have numbers.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.560
They represent things in a bunch of different ways.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.200
Some of the ways, you put two numbers.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.720
You put a plus sign between them.

39:56.720 --> 39:57.800
Here you have some other format.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.120
You have some line between them.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.160
Competition's really love notation.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.360
Here you put some number.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.520
You put some house over it.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.040
You get another number.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.600
Here you just put a word and you get another value.

40:08.600 --> 40:12.480
So, here you can use another language, Greek,

40:12.480 --> 40:14.840
and you just suddenly have another thing.

40:14.840 --> 40:18.800
So, and there's a bunch of these.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.000
Okay, so, mathematics has a lot of ways

40:21.000 --> 40:22.400
that they like to describe things

40:22.400 --> 40:24.360
because they like doing notation

40:24.360 --> 40:26.440
and having really short hand in the research papers.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.240
It's really hard to read.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.240
In computer science, we really like to simplify things.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.320
So, in computer science, the only thing

40:33.320 --> 40:35.040
that we really care about is this one

40:35.040 --> 40:36.560
a particular f of x.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.400
What this is kind of saying

40:39.400 --> 40:41.520
is that we're taking in some particular value

40:41.520 --> 40:43.480
and we're going to manipulate it in some way.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.400
Really general, it's really abstract.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.520
Take something, change it.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.680
The function f describes how we're going to change it.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.440
The input x is just the particular value

40:51.440 --> 40:52.280
that we care about.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.280
I claim that every single one of these kind of expressions

40:57.280 --> 40:58.520
or any other sort of expression

40:58.520 --> 41:00.120
that we might think about in math,

41:00.120 --> 41:01.360
that these can actually be represented

41:01.360 --> 41:03.000
in this f of x notation.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.840
And so, we're actually going to look at this in,

41:06.840 --> 41:11.320
Python, would somebody be willing to hold this

41:11.320 --> 41:12.960
since it isn't working?

41:14.320 --> 41:16.000
I think we're going to download.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.440
I put on a college shirt

41:23.440 --> 41:24.760
because supposedly they work best,

41:24.760 --> 41:26.480
but apparently they work worse.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.320
Not me or sis?

41:27.320 --> 41:28.160
Thank you.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.480
Okay, so,

41:29.480 --> 41:36.480
what I just did is I open me, this is just in Linux,

41:39.680 --> 41:41.520
it's similar in Mac and Windows,

41:41.520 --> 41:43.320
you'll probably use Git Bash.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.840
If I went to open the Python interpreter,

41:44.840 --> 41:46.080
I typed Python 3.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.480
So what this is, is it's a looping mechanism

41:48.480 --> 41:49.600
where we can type in things,

41:49.600 --> 41:51.080
Python figures out what the means

41:51.080 --> 41:53.040
and what I typed and then it returns the value.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.560
So for example, I can type 2019,

41:55.560 --> 41:57.080
it figures out what 2019 is,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.280
there's nothing special and we output that.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.280
The other thing we can do is we could do addition.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.520
We can output some other values.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.600
So here it's figuring out that we want to add to numbers.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.760
It calculates the addition and then puts them together.

42:08.760 --> 42:12.160
We can also do addition, we can do division,

42:12.160 --> 42:16.000
we can do more addition, we can do nested equations,

42:20.200 --> 42:22.880
we can do more multiple locations.

42:22.880 --> 42:25.800
And it automatically knows the sort of standard

42:25.800 --> 42:28.120
orders of operation and it'll sort of evaluate it

42:28.120 --> 42:30.440
in the normal way that we're used to.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.800
Another thing that we can do in the sort of functional

42:32.800 --> 42:35.000
notation that I was mentioning is there's some built in

42:35.000 --> 42:35.920
things that we can type.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.080
So we can say max of two numbers.

42:38.080 --> 42:41.040
It's going to return the value that it's a maximum.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.400
The function notation just says,

42:42.400 --> 42:44.040
okay, there's something that we want to call

42:44.040 --> 42:45.440
and we're to separate these in parentheses

42:45.440 --> 42:47.040
and put some commas between these things.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.880
This is how Python more or less knows

42:48.880 --> 42:50.960
that we're doing a function call.

42:50.960 --> 42:55.240
We can do min, calculates minimum.

42:55.240 --> 43:00.240
And this is great null, but I claim that we can do

43:01.560 --> 43:03.800
everything in this function call notation.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.960
Right here we're not doing this with the addition.

43:05.960 --> 43:10.200
And it doesn't quite work that we can't just do this.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.280
It's going to give some strange error

43:11.280 --> 43:12.840
that doesn't quite make sense.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.400
We actually have to do it, it's kind of the way

43:14.400 --> 43:17.600
Python works, we have to run this line.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.440
And this is kind of the underlying behavior

43:22.440 --> 43:24.080
of how the addition and multiplication works

43:24.080 --> 43:25.960
and it allows us to do this other format.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.560
So we can now add things together,

43:27.560 --> 43:30.440
we can multiply things together, let me.

43:32.760 --> 43:36.040
And another thing we can do is if you've ever seen

43:36.040 --> 43:39.480
in mathematics where we do multiple values

43:39.480 --> 43:40.520
in a particular function,

43:40.520 --> 43:42.840
we can actually just separate them in more commas.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.840
We'll get more values.

43:45.840 --> 43:55.640
We can also nest them, and it'll automatically figure out

43:55.640 --> 43:58.320
the order of evaluation based on the nesting structure.

43:58.320 --> 44:00.280
And so the nice part about using this call

44:00.280 --> 44:04.360
expression notation is it's very clear what goes where.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.920
We are going to evaluate the multiplication of 4 and 56

44:06.920 --> 44:08.520
before we add to do it.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.480
We're going to figure out what our validation is

44:10.480 --> 44:13.360
before we max that in the other addition.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.680
And sort of this nested structure makes it very clear.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.600
In the first lines that we're doing,

44:17.600 --> 44:20.240
you have to kind of know the order of operations

44:20.240 --> 44:22.160
of mathematics, and maybe you're too lazy

44:22.160 --> 44:23.160
and you don't remember that.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.200
Having this sort of consistent notation

44:25.200 --> 44:28.400
is very nice for program languages as well as computers

44:28.400 --> 44:29.960
because it just follows a simple set of rules

44:29.960 --> 44:31.640
and it'll figure out what it is.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.080
Are there any questions about that?

44:40.320 --> 44:41.320
All right, cool.

44:41.320 --> 44:42.480
Thank you.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.640
I don't know how to get back.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.320
Maybe.

44:45.320 --> 44:48.200
OK, so call expressions itself.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.240
We're going to look kind of like how they're formatted

44:50.240 --> 44:51.480
and how they work.

44:51.480 --> 44:55.400
So a general call expression here, we're saying add 2 and 3.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.960
This whole thing is what we call a call expression.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.200
The way you kind of know there's the name of the function.

44:59.200 --> 45:00.120
There's some parentheses.

45:00.120 --> 45:02.680
There's some values separated by commas.

45:02.680 --> 45:05.560
Some terminology we call add the operator.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.680
This is the thing that we're operating on the values.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.480
Add will do the addition.

45:09.480 --> 45:11.240
And the other things are calling operands.

45:11.240 --> 45:13.080
So operators apply to operands.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.440
We're applying add 2 and 3.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.440
In this case, it's not a particularly complex call

45:20.440 --> 45:22.280
expression, but in the case that we saw in the demo,

45:22.280 --> 45:23.520
we saw nested structures.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.480
So each of these values can also be expressions themselves.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.000
Instead of two, I could have said mole 5 and 6.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.720
And I could have had some other value.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.160
And it needs to sort of figure out these values

45:32.160 --> 45:35.680
before it does this kind of application.

45:35.680 --> 45:38.400
The exact way that Python goes about this

45:38.400 --> 45:40.960
is the first thing it does is it sees this as a call

45:40.960 --> 45:43.520
expression, it says, all right, I want to figure out

45:43.520 --> 45:44.880
what this evaluates to.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.080
So the first thing I'm going to do is figure out

45:47.080 --> 45:48.720
what is the operator?

45:48.720 --> 45:50.560
In this case, it's just looking up what add is.

45:50.560 --> 45:53.240
It says, OK, this is some thing that does addition,

45:53.240 --> 45:56.040
takes some numbers, and adds them together.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.560
The next thing it does is it goes through each of the

45:57.560 --> 45:58.040
operands.

45:58.040 --> 45:59.920
These are the arguments that we're plugging in.

45:59.920 --> 46:02.840
It figures out what 2 is, it figures out what 3 is.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.440
Now that we've kind of figured out all these values,

46:04.440 --> 46:06.160
and the reason why we're doing this is because in the case

46:06.160 --> 46:08.640
I mentioned, if 2 is instead mole 4 and 5,

46:08.640 --> 46:11.520
we have to figure out what 4 times 5 is before we can add

46:11.520 --> 46:15.040
4 times 5 and 3.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.560
Once we've figured out all these values,

46:16.560 --> 46:18.760
we can actually do this application.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.520
So we know what addition is.

46:21.520 --> 46:23.320
We know what 2 and 3 is.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.080
So now we can actually add 2 and 3 according to how

46:26.080 --> 46:28.920
addition works.

46:28.920 --> 46:32.520
By following this very precise sort of set of rules,

46:32.520 --> 46:35.000
it allows us to understand how computers are going about

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
to calculate any arbitrary sort of value.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.520
And because it's so simple, and it's these sort of three

46:42.520 --> 46:45.800
relatively simple steps, computers can follow this

46:45.800 --> 46:47.320
relatively quickly.

46:47.320 --> 46:49.120
It says, all right, I don't have to really think about how

46:49.120 --> 46:50.000
this is structured.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.600
Do this step, this step, and then this step,

46:51.600 --> 46:54.600
and I'll have the result.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.760
So we're going to look at an example.

46:55.760 --> 47:03.080
So it's add, we're adding 6 and 4 times 6 as well as 3 times 5.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.960
So as people, the way we kind of approach this

47:05.960 --> 47:08.200
is we look from the inside out.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.840
The first thing that we're going to try and figure out

47:09.840 --> 47:11.800
is what's 4 times 6.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.160
We're going to get 24.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.920
Now after this, we're going to add 6 and 24.

47:15.920 --> 47:16.760
We're going to get 30.

47:16.760 --> 47:19.280
We're going to multiply 3 times 5, 15, and add these together.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.840
We're going to get 45.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.280
So when I look at this, I can quickly say, OK, what's the

47:25.280 --> 47:26.760
innermost call?

47:26.760 --> 47:27.920
OK, it's 4 times 6.

47:27.920 --> 47:29.520
So I should probably do that one first.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.880
You can also imagine saying, OK, I'll actually do 3 times 5.

47:31.880 --> 47:34.320
Then I'll do 4 times 6, and then I'll add them together,

47:34.320 --> 47:38.000
as long as we're kind of building up through the levels.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.280
Computers in Python can't quite do this.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.480
It needs to have a specific set of rules.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.920
And while we're kind of as people can look at the whole thing,

47:44.920 --> 47:46.960
kind of jump around and do whatever we want,

47:46.960 --> 47:50.600
programs need to follow a very specific set of rules.

47:50.600 --> 47:53.160
The way we would do this in sort of the following the 3 steps

47:53.160 --> 47:55.760
that we said before is we're going to follow these 3 steps.

47:55.760 --> 47:57.520
If I like to operator, the operands and apply.

47:57.520 --> 47:59.560
This is something that will be set a lot.

47:59.560 --> 48:01.920
I'm probably in discussion as well as lecture.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.320
And the process for this is here.

48:03.320 --> 48:04.880
We see a call expression.

48:04.880 --> 48:05.960
We're going to evaluate the operator.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.160
In this case, it's just addition.

48:07.160 --> 48:09.160
Nothing particularly complex.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.600
The next thing is the operand.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.400
We're going to add 6 and multiplication of 4 and 6.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.080
We have to figure out what this is before we can actually

48:15.080 --> 48:17.680
do the top level addition.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.360
To figure out what this value is, we have to repeat the set.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.760
Evaluate the operator.

48:21.760 --> 48:22.640
Evaluate the operand.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.640
In this case, it's 6.

48:23.640 --> 48:25.080
So we just get 6.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.480
And we repeat the process.

48:26.480 --> 48:30.040
We evaluate the operator, the operand, and the operand.

48:30.040 --> 48:32.040
Now for this sub-expression, mole 4 and 6,

48:32.040 --> 48:35.120
we figured out the first 2 steps.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.200
We've added, we figured out what the operator is.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.640
We figured out what the operands.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.440
We can now do this final step of applying things.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.960
We can say multiplication 4 times 6, the 24.

48:42.960 --> 48:45.600
We'll kind of go up this tree structure.

48:45.600 --> 48:47.240
Because it's like branching out.

48:47.240 --> 48:48.920
Then we'll say 6 plus 30.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.760
Now to figure out the top level, we have to kind of go

48:50.760 --> 48:53.200
through this again.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.440
And so this is how computers are actually

48:54.440 --> 48:57.240
going about solving these, like you've given instruction.

48:57.240 --> 48:58.800
It says, all right, let's compute this value.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.520
And this is a process that it's going through.

49:00.520 --> 49:03.400
It says, first, let's look at the uppermost level.

49:03.400 --> 49:04.600
All right, what are we looking at?

49:04.600 --> 49:05.600
A call expression.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.720
All right, let's look at the operator.

49:06.720 --> 49:07.520
Let's look at the operands.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.640
Let's kind of go through this structure

49:08.640 --> 49:10.480
and to figure out all of the possible values.

49:10.480 --> 49:14.120
And we kind of resolved ultimately what we're trying to do.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.600
There's whole things called an expression tree,

49:16.600 --> 49:19.920
where we have each of the things being the expressions.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.360
And they break into sub-expressions.

49:21.360 --> 49:25.640
And each of these evaluate to some particular value.

49:25.640 --> 49:26.800
Are there any questions about this?

49:32.040 --> 49:33.000
Cool.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.680
And then we're going to do another demo.

49:35.680 --> 49:38.240
Thank you.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.280
OK, so a couple of concepts in this course

49:40.280 --> 49:42.560
are functions, values, objects, interpreters, and data.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.960
So you've seen the interpreter.

49:43.960 --> 49:45.320
That's the type of interpreter.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.240
We can type in things.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.920
It evaluates things.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.520
I mentioned functions like add and mole.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.880
Values are like numbers.

49:50.880 --> 49:55.280
And we'll see a little bit of objects in data.

49:55.280 --> 49:57.480
In this demo, I'm going to be using some things

49:57.480 --> 49:59.000
that we haven't taught.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.880
But the point is not too confusing.

50:00.880 --> 50:04.320
The point is just if we had to introduce all these concepts,

50:04.320 --> 50:07.360
it would get to a cool demo in the first day.

50:07.360 --> 50:08.840
So we want to do that.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.320
So I'm just going to kind of do some things.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.600
You aren't going to have to understand everything.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.000
If you come back maybe later in this semester,

50:13.000 --> 50:14.560
some of these might make more sense.

50:14.560 --> 50:19.600
OK, so a long time ago, there is this author Shakespeare.

50:19.600 --> 50:22.800
I have a file on my computer.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.440
Actually, I think I need to.

50:34.280 --> 50:35.080
Nope.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.280
I misspelled Shakespeare.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.320
All right.

50:37.320 --> 50:39.160
Cool.

50:39.160 --> 50:41.600
So what this is, is this is a text document with a bunch,

50:41.600 --> 50:43.760
or I think all of Shakespeare's writings.

50:43.760 --> 50:46.440
So we can get the particular values,

50:46.440 --> 50:48.480
so we can read the data from this file,

50:48.480 --> 50:49.720
and then we can split these into words.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.200
This is going to be common.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.560
OK.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.800
So what is in this?

50:58.800 --> 51:02.040
We go to the first 25 words, and we see the first play,

51:02.040 --> 51:02.920
at least in this document.

51:02.920 --> 51:03.840
And it's a very nice game.

51:03.840 --> 51:07.360
That's the first words, and it tells the play itself.

51:07.360 --> 51:10.080
OK, so we can ask Python how many words are in Shakespeare?

51:10.080 --> 51:12.920
OK.

51:12.920 --> 51:16.360
So there's 980,000 words in all of the text of Shakespeare.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.520
If we're going to do this manually, it's take a long time.

51:18.520 --> 51:21.440
But Python did this pretty quick.

51:21.440 --> 51:22.560
So this is pretty impressive.

51:22.560 --> 51:26.160
But let's actually take a closer look.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.840
So let's ask, OK, how many of these words to Shakespeare write

51:28.840 --> 51:30.760
are actually the word the?

51:30.760 --> 51:34.400
So it turns out 23,000 of every word that Shakespeare wrote

51:34.400 --> 51:35.320
is just the word that is.

51:35.320 --> 51:41.960
So that's about 2%, something like that.

51:41.960 --> 51:45.640
I don't think we can look at is, if you notice, in the first line,

51:45.640 --> 51:46.760
we see a bunch of commas.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.120
So because of the way I split this, commas are also considered words.

51:50.120 --> 51:53.600
So let's actually look at how many commas there are.

51:53.600 --> 51:57.680
So there's actually 81,000 commas just in Shakespeare.

51:57.680 --> 51:58.600
So that's how many words are.

51:58.600 --> 52:00.600
We can figure out exactly what percentages

52:00.600 --> 52:03.600
by dividing this by how many words there are.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.080
We get about 8% of Shakespeare's just commas.

52:08.920 --> 52:11.360
And I think we do say, OK, there's a lot of repeats.

52:11.360 --> 52:12.600
Clearly, there's a lot of does.

52:12.600 --> 52:13.840
But maybe we're only interested in looking

52:13.840 --> 52:15.960
at the particular unique words.

52:15.960 --> 52:18.520
So the way we can do that is we can say, all right, only

52:18.520 --> 52:24.200
with unique words from Shakespeare.

52:24.200 --> 52:30.000
And now we can check, OK, is that in the words that Shakespeare has?

52:30.000 --> 52:31.520
Yeah, so it is.

52:31.520 --> 52:33.240
All right, how many words, unique words

52:33.240 --> 52:34.360
does Shakespeare use?

52:34.360 --> 52:37.520
OK, they have 33,000 unique words in Shakespeare.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.520
That's a lot.

52:39.520 --> 52:44.360
Another thing we can do is we can do some string manipulation.

52:44.360 --> 52:48.280
So here, if I put this thing in quotes,

52:48.280 --> 52:49.680
this is way Python says, all right,

52:49.680 --> 52:53.440
we're just going to type this string of characters in a word.

52:53.440 --> 52:56.040
Another thing we can do is we can actually reverse words.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.480
So now it's word.

52:57.480 --> 52:58.200
Oh, that's interesting.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.920
John Ward are both actually words.

53:00.920 --> 53:04.680
So maybe we can look in Shakespeare, which words are also

53:04.680 --> 53:05.880
inside of their reverse.

53:05.880 --> 53:11.640
So the way we do that is we're going to look over all the words.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.320
You don't have to understand what I'm doing right here.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.680
Yeah, OK, I guess that's a good point.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.240
We're going to clarify the goal of this.

53:21.240 --> 53:26.000
The goal is to show that Shakespeare has a lot of words.

53:26.000 --> 53:30.240
And the power of computers, it allows us to go through things

53:30.240 --> 53:35.160
automatically in order to see a lot of analysis and sort of data

53:35.160 --> 53:37.440
that would be really painful to do manually.

53:37.440 --> 53:41.040
Computers do this almost instantly and basically instantly.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.440
Well, if we were to do this manually, you'd take a long time.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.200
And so we can leverage the power of computers

53:45.200 --> 53:46.680
to sort of do this analysis on data, which

53:46.680 --> 53:48.920
was the other topic in this course.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.760
We've also seen sets, which are actually objects.

53:51.760 --> 53:53.080
And you can make believe these.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.840
We'll kind of cover each of these concepts

53:54.840 --> 53:58.480
that I mentioned a little bit more in depth throughout the course.

53:58.480 --> 54:09.080
OK, so here, I'm looking at all the words that are also

54:09.080 --> 54:10.080
the reverse of the words.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.960
So this is going to be palindroms, I guess.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.560
So we see all of the palindroms and Shakespeare, which

54:19.560 --> 54:21.800
are length greater than four, or these ones.

54:21.800 --> 54:25.160
So writer is also a writer, level is level.

54:25.160 --> 54:30.480
One of the thing we can do is we can look in Shakespeare.

54:30.480 --> 54:34.320
Maybe we only care about if the word is actually also in the words.

54:37.640 --> 54:40.360
So here, we're looking at all the words of length four,

54:40.360 --> 54:42.760
that when you take the word, you reverse it.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.880
It's also in Shakespeare.

54:44.880 --> 54:53.440
So let's see, there's, I don't know if these are words.

54:53.440 --> 54:57.120
I'm not quite.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.840
OK, gums and smug.

54:59.840 --> 55:00.360
Oh, snug.

55:00.360 --> 55:01.280
Oh, no, these are words.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.680
OK, move and pull.

55:02.680 --> 55:03.720
Yes, OK.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.760
This is why I guess the computer science major.

55:05.760 --> 55:10.480
OK, we can also look at length five.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.600
So we have some more.

55:11.600 --> 55:14.040
We can look at length six, all right.

55:14.040 --> 55:15.320
There's still some more.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.840
Are there seven?

55:16.840 --> 55:17.760
So there's no more.

55:17.760 --> 55:20.800
Are there any more greater than seven?

55:20.800 --> 55:22.200
OK.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.080
So we're kind of in our adoptions.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.760
And the reason for this is Shakespeare didn't use all of the words

55:26.760 --> 55:27.760
of the English dictionary.

55:27.760 --> 55:31.720
We can also actually load in, let's see.

55:31.720 --> 55:34.720
I need to figure out the document.

55:34.720 --> 55:37.120
So on my computer, I have a file.

55:37.120 --> 55:39.080
You don't have to understand this.

55:39.080 --> 56:02.760
OK, so now I've loaded in the dictionary of all of the words

56:02.760 --> 56:04.880
on my computer, at least in this one dictionary.

56:04.880 --> 56:10.360
So now, look at the length of words, there's now 102,000.

56:10.360 --> 56:13.880
So originally we had, I think, 30-ish,000.

56:13.880 --> 56:17.360
So we've increased the number of words by a lot.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.240
So we can do things like, OK, what

56:19.240 --> 56:23.240
is the longest word in this list of words or a set of words?

56:23.240 --> 56:25.600
We can take all the words.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.200
We can say, all right, what I care about

56:27.200 --> 56:29.640
is the length of these.

56:29.640 --> 56:31.360
OK, so this is the longest word in the dictionary.

56:31.360 --> 56:35.880
Oh, I'm not going to try to pronounce that.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.880
We can also look alphabetically.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.720
We can say, OK, what's the last word in the dictionary alphabetically?

56:40.720 --> 56:41.760
We get it toads.

56:45.680 --> 56:46.800
Let's see, what else can we do?

56:46.800 --> 56:49.680
We can go back to the original thing we had.

56:49.680 --> 56:55.480
We're saying all the words, which also have reverses in it,

56:55.480 --> 56:56.960
which are length 6.

56:56.960 --> 56:58.360
So we see there's a little bit more words.

56:58.360 --> 56:59.760
And then we can, again, are there

56:59.760 --> 57:00.920
anyone's greater than 6?

57:00.920 --> 57:03.520
So in this case, we actually have more of these.

57:03.520 --> 57:16.160
So stressed and desir, desir, oh, OK, OK, so we can actually,

57:16.160 --> 57:20.480
for example, we could say, OK, what is the largest word?

57:20.480 --> 57:30.960
Such that.

57:30.960 --> 57:34.880
So we're looking at the longest word

57:34.880 --> 57:39.200
in this set of words, such that the reverses in it.

57:39.200 --> 57:40.520
And we get stressed and desir.

57:40.520 --> 57:41.020
Cool.

57:43.520 --> 57:46.240
OK, so this is kind of all I have for this.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.440
Are there any other things you guys would be interested in looking at

57:48.440 --> 57:51.160
what we could do in this sort of data set?

57:51.160 --> 57:57.240
Maybe like looking up words that are, I don't know,

57:57.240 --> 57:58.200
are there any ideas?

57:58.200 --> 57:58.680
Yeah.

57:58.680 --> 58:00.040
How many words start with A?

58:00.040 --> 58:01.240
How many words start with A?

58:01.240 --> 58:11.440
OK, so we could take how many words, if the first letter is A?

58:11.440 --> 58:13.360
So 4,600, so many things.

58:13.360 --> 58:18.400
And then I think, yeah, so some of these, let's say,

58:18.400 --> 58:36.120
let's say, this, except now, we're going to look at that for.

58:36.120 --> 58:40.400
OK, so 6,000 words, ignoring capitalization, start with A.

58:40.400 --> 58:41.280
Any other guess?

58:41.280 --> 58:41.800
Yeah.

58:41.800 --> 58:43.440
Is there a simple way in it?

58:43.440 --> 58:46.160
So instead, in that stop-up, I mean,

58:46.160 --> 58:48.640
that's stressed and dessert is another thing,

58:48.640 --> 58:53.360
versus avoiding A, so that those between ones won't be there.

58:53.360 --> 58:57.760
So we only care about, so if there's a word like stress,

58:57.760 --> 58:59.840
you don't care about the inverse of it.

58:59.840 --> 59:04.960
Yeah, so in other words, you can do that is back in this one.

59:04.960 --> 59:06.800
Not this one.

59:06.800 --> 59:09.760
So another thing we can say is, I can't hear a people if you want this

59:09.760 --> 59:10.160
too.

59:10.160 --> 59:11.160
Oh, yeah.

59:11.160 --> 59:11.720
Thank you.

59:11.720 --> 59:14.480
He asked, is there anything we could exclude the reverse of the

59:14.480 --> 59:14.680
word?

59:14.680 --> 59:17.280
So we got stressed, but maybe we don't want desserts as well.

59:17.280 --> 59:18.680
Or maybe we want desserts, but not stressed, if you don't

59:18.680 --> 59:20.080
want to reverse.

59:20.080 --> 59:29.560
So the way you can do that is we can say, and we only care

59:29.560 --> 59:33.200
about the one that is actually smaller alphabetically.

59:33.200 --> 59:36.440
So we get two of them.

59:36.440 --> 59:36.880
Cool.

59:36.880 --> 59:38.400
So this actually excluded palindromes.

59:38.400 --> 59:43.040
We can actually say less than or equal if we care about palindromes.

59:43.040 --> 59:43.560
Cool.

59:43.560 --> 59:46.640
Because deified is also the reverse.

59:46.640 --> 59:47.640
Yeah.

59:47.640 --> 59:50.600
How is the number that's not had out for this?

59:50.600 --> 59:51.640
Do you know what that is?

59:51.640 --> 59:52.640
Do you know what that is?

59:52.640 --> 59:54.640
That's what that is.

59:54.640 --> 59:57.280
That's what the word is.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.760
Um, I'm interested in what are the words that

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:06.320
store the capital H or the lower key say?

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:18.200
This might elucidate something.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.920
There's a lot.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:33.880
Oh, so the reason why is let's look at...

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.240
So some of these words like arctic also have the capitalization.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.120
So when we lowercase them, we don't care about the ones

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120
that we're also duplicated.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.160
Any other ideas?

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.160
Yeah.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.440
Most number of vowels.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.440
Most number of vowels.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440
Okay.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.480
So we can say, um, we're going to max over the words, uh, you

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.800
don't need to know what this means, uh, I'm going to say...

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800
But you will see.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.240
You'll be able to understand all of this.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240
Yes.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:22.360
And we want to, um, uh, one for W in X if, uh, let's see, uh,

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:44.960
so this is the word that has the most, uh, like the word that has the most, uh,

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:56.920
the most repeating single letter, um, so we can say, we want the maximum word where the

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:03.320
key is equal to, well, okay, so we can do it with a specific vowel.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:09.280
So if I said which one has the most ease, we get teleconference, it's a X, which one

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:17.600
has the most X's, X ons, not quite sure how you do with all of the letters, though.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.680
Yeah, you'd have to kind of go through all the letters and then get the maximum over

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680
all of those.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.240
So we'd have to sit here and type a long string with the whole alphabet.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.280
We could do it, but it'll take a while.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:03:00.000
Oh, yeah, he's saying like, um, he's saying to the subtract the set of unique letters

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.760
from the length of the word, um, because then you'll have a, but like, I think that that

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.760
version, right?

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.480
So if you have two letters that both repeat a lot, you want to certainly get the one word

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.000
with the most repeats of the same letter, right?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.760
Like, okay, basically the probably isn't easy way to do this, but we don't know if the

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:35.360
top of our head, but I think that approach would, I mean, yeah, you could say, oh, my

01:03:35.360 --> 01:04:03.360
God, okay, so I'm iterating over all the letters and I'm saying, and now it's intact.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:21.720
Oh, no, I don't need this, nope, generics, oh, okay, I see, I have the most A's, I guess,

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:29.040
wait, that's like not that many A's, I think maybe it's a lot of A's, yeah, I guess I

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:41.120
guess it's a lot of A's, yeah, use a regular expression, maybe, I'm not very good at

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:54.720
regular expression, okay, cool, yes, I can hold it up for you, cool.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.680
So I guess the purpose is going to show you some neat things you can do in Python, you

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.120
can actually download the Shakespeare text, it's in the textbook, I think it's one of the

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.960
first links, if you go to the 1.1 chapter, if you want to mess around with it yourself,

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:11.000
it's just kind of show you the neat things you can do in Python, what kind of moving on

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.560
to some other kind of building up and maybe by the end of the semester, you kind of understand

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:20.320
all the specific things that we've done and how you might approach these for yourself.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:34.680
Anyway, tomorrow, thank you all for coming, we'll be up here if you have any questions.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:57.320
Thank you.
