77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,360
All right, we're going to do some visualizations today.

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's have some here.

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
I see a couple there.

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,680
All right, tell them please.

81
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,080
Announcements, same as last time.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,040
Thank you for all those people who are keeping their hands up.

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,600
But please take advantage of all that seats.

84
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:50,960
Thank you.

85
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,440
Same as last time, homework is you tomorrow.

86
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,760
You get an extra point for turning it in today.

87
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,040
The routine is the same every week.

88
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,920
Small group tutoring sessions have been announced on Piazza.

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,120
If you feel that it might help you, then please take advantage of it.

90
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,920
They're filling up.

91
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:18,240
OK, I want to pick up where we left off last time.

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,680
What we had done last time was we had gone through a series of table operations on columns

93
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,440
and rows.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,920
And then we had taken a dataset from the census.

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:37,480
And we were just about to start looking at the data and interpreting it when time was up.

96
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,160
So let's review where we were.

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,280
As we said last time, the census is a every 10 year thing.

98
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,960
Every 10 years, the US government counts.

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,840
The number of people in the United States.

100
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
And it's not citizens or anything.

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,160
It's just how many people are in the United States.

102
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,360
And the reason for doing that is the Constitution says that there are

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,120
a portionment, representation, and federal funds and so on

104
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,320
are connected with the number of people in each state.

105
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
This is a massive undertaking.

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,120
It's quite difficult.

107
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,160
But it's done every 10 years and also in between those 10-year periods.

108
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,360
There are estimates made every year.

109
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,600
So that people are prepared for what might come up in the next census.

110
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,360
And governments and so on can make policy based on more current data than

111
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,480
data from 10 years ago.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,800
We saw a dataset that we had loaded from the census.

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,360
And there was a sex column, which had some codes.

114
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,000
And then there was an age column with age and years.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
And I'll just go over.

116
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,720
The sex column had a numerical code for male female.

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,480
And the estimates were done at a particular time.

118
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,840
The population estimates were done at a particular time of the year.

119
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,840
The columns also had some aggregated data.

120
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,400
So the sex column, when you see a code of zero, it was everybody.

121
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,680
And the remarkable age of 99 years is actually not 99 years at all.

122
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,040
It was everybody of all ages.

123
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,400
So instead of writing male and female, or everyone,

124
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,680
they were using numeric codes.

125
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,520
This is for storage efficiency.

126
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,640
And also, because you don't want to be typing words all the time.

127
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,840
Often, very often, numerical codes are used.

128
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,800
That doesn't mean they're actually numbers.

129
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,960
I'll come to that later.

130
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
So values in a column have the same type.

131
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,040
You know that they're arrays.

132
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,320
The point that we're trying to make here at the end is age 12 is actually 12 years old.

133
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,880
That's a kid.

134
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,280
You can imagine that age 9.99 is not an age.

135
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,600
It's a number here, as far as a computer is concerned, but it's not an age.

136
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,680
And when we interpret data in tables, we have to keep things like that in mind.

137
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,760
And where do you know what's going on, like what these codes mean?

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,000
You have to read the documentation provided by the people who made the table.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And so there's a link to that at the bottom there.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So what I'd like to do is I'd like to get started by reviewing where we were.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So there was a census data.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The census provides data in this file right here.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And we read it into a table called full.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And that has a sex column and age column and various population columns,

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
from which we selected four columns into a partial table,

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
which we called partial.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This thing had a 306 rows, and it had sex age.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The estimate in 2010 and the estimate in 2014 of the total population.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it's broken down by each group and each label for sex.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We did not like these long column labels, and so we did some relabeling.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We relabeled that long pop estimate 2010 to be just 2010,

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
and then we were too lazy to even type in pop estimate 2014.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So we just used the column index there.

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We relabeled column three to be column 2014, and we took a look at that.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And now you have a table that is a little easier to comprehend and work with,

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and so that's what we're going to start doing.

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think last time we had also decided that we didn't like looking at large numbers

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and not knowing how big they were, so we used number four matter.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And now you can see that you have essentially four million people in each of those cells.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Every age group, four million people, and these are the little tiny ones,

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
age zero through nine that you can see.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But then the table continues.

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We took a look at the age labels, and there was 9.99.

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So we've seen everybody put together, everybody of all ages, put together there.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Sex was one male, two females, zero, everybody, and so what we're going to do now

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
is because it is extremely disconcerting to work with ages of 999.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're going to do some further reduction of this table.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'd like you to look at age 100.

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Age 100 there isn't exactly 100 years, it's 100 plus.

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Everybody, 100 plus was lumped in there, and that's where the numbers are bigger.

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And we'll look at them again.

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But so even 100 isn't 100 years old, it's 100 plus, 999 is everybody.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So now, I will take one short pause for questions.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is exactly where we were, I think, last time.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So the first thing we'll do is we will get rid of the 999.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So I'll create a table called no 999, where you take this table and you take the rows where the age,

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
column index one, are below 999.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And I do that, and I don't see anything because that's an assignment statement.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's fine.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm not going to run the same thing twice.

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What I'm going to do is I'm going to extract a table for everybody.

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So from this, every row where sex is equal to zero, and then we'll make a table for the guys.

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And for the girls and the women, and so we create those three tables.

184
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And we take a look at table called females.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And so that's, okay, at every age zero through 100, you have the number of females in the years 2010 and the year 2014.

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And I look at that sex column.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, this is the table of females.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Every single one of them is going to be a two.

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's rather boring.

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So we should not be carrying around a column that just has all two's in it.

191
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So how about we go back?

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We haven't messed with no 99, so we're just going to drop column zero here for all of them.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Now, actually, we have some data there that are interesting to look at.

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So we have the females, and we have the males as well, and I have a question for you.

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So you can see that there's slight differences in how many females there are at each age group.

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
For example, there are more of more nine-year-olds than tiny, tiny, tiny infants.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You see that?

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah?

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So among the females, which age do you think is the most populous?

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Talk to your friends and neighbors.

202
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can't tell that from here.

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You just have to guess based on what you know.

204
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:46,000
All right.

205
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Since everybody is guessing, everybody is guessing somebody call out a guess.

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sorry?

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Five zero?

208
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Six zero.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Six.

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Somebody guess a 60 roughly why?

211
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Baby boom.

212
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
All right.

213
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's a good guess.

214
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Others.

215
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Other candidates?

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes?

217
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Above 100.

218
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Above 100.

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
All right.

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Because there's lots of ages in there.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
More.

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
37, because.

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Because there's lots of ages in there.

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Close it up.

225
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Baby boom.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They haven't died yet.

227
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay.

228
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Great.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So then more of it, as it might seem, that is exactly the kind of thing you have to think

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
about, yes.

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
About 20?

232
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
About 20, why?

233
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Because that would be about when the generation above the liners are stopping being the major

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
segment of producing kids since millennials are notoriously not producing kids.

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, wow.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So now we're looking at millennials.

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's a lot of them, but they don't have a lot of kids.

238
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And so maybe their kids are all over 20.

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So now maybe let's look at the 20-year-olds and there's a lot of them.

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So shall we actually look?

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Let's actually look.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What?

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No.

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No.

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No.

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I already know that 100 is bigger than 99.

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is silly.

248
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay.

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I'm just going to look at the 2014 population.

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So who said 60?

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think you're the closest.

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes?

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
All right.

255
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So there's more in 2014.

256
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There were more 54 or 53-year-old women than anything else.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
20, somebody said 20s.

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You had 20s.

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Somebody else had 20s?

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah.

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So you guys weren't doing so badly.

262
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But you can see they're all sort of in the 50s and in the 20s.

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Which is interesting.

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's quite interesting to see whether the picture is the same for

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the men.

266
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No.

267
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Not the same for the men.

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Most common for men is 23.

269
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
There is a 54.

270
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can see what is way down.

271
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
All right.

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And so these very dry numbers are telling a story.

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
They're telling a story that guys' lives are genuinely different from

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
women's lives.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And also their biology are different.

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So what we're going to do now is we're going to take a look a

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:05,000
little more carefully at these data and maybe what we can do is

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
create one table with both genders.

279
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So let's just call it population 2014.

280
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So I'm just going to look at the year 2014 and you can change

281
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:30,000
it later.

282
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So for age I can pick any one of these first columns.

283
00:18:45,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So I'm going to take a look at the picture.

284
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay.

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So look at the number of males compared to the number of females at

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
these different age groups.

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Do you notice something?

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Consistently fewer little girls than boys of the same age.

289
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Look at age zero.

290
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Those are the kids just born.

291
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The proportion of females is not 50%.

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This has long been the case and there's some biology that I

293
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
does not clear to me is completely well understood.

294
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The proportion, a baby born is slightly less likely to be a

295
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
female than male.

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And at all of these ages, the proportion of females is

297
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
slightly less.

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why don't we just work out what the proportion is and then

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
we'll take a look at what that looks like across all the

300
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
ages that we can't see.

301
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So we'll create an array called percent females.

302
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Okay.

303
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So we will convert these numbers to a percent of the total.

304
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yep.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
How do I find the total?

306
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, it's a sum of these two.

307
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So we will take white dot column and not select because it's

308
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
an array.

309
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I want to do arithmetic with it.

310
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't want to just visualize on the table.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I want to do some arithmetic.

312
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Okay.

313
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I've got to take it and add it.

314
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And if I do that, I will get a fraction.

315
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So why don't I convert that into a percent by multiplying by

316
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
100.

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And then we create a new table called counts and

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
percent, which is our old table pop 2014.

319
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay.

320
00:21:46,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So just about 49% female throughout in these age groups.

321
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay.

322
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So now what does this look like for all the other age groups?

323
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Of course, we could turn the table over and sort by age in

324
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
descending order and take a look.

325
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But it's a good idea to draw a picture.

326
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's just crying out for us to draw a picture.

327
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And so what we will do is we will now draw some

328
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
line graphs.

329
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
These are plots.

330
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And so I will take the table dot plot produces a line graph.

331
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And we will plot the age on the horizontal axis.

332
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So the columns are age, and we will plot a percent female on

333
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:55,000
the vertical.

334
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That is interesting.

335
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You start out proportion female is just below 50% by about 40

336
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
males and females in equal proportions and what happens to

337
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
the senior citizens.

338
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
At the higher ages, you're seeing quite substantially more

339
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
females than males.

340
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So that is an interesting observation from this graph.

341
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And we look at it a little more carefully.

342
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I just want to go over the call.

343
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So if you want, you have a table of data and you want to draw

344
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
a line plot of one column versus another, then table dot

345
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
plot to you can use two arguments.

346
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The first one will represent the horizontal axis and the

347
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
second one will represent the vertical.

348
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
All right.

349
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So what would be nice is to look at the males and

350
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
females separately and possibly on the same graph if possible.

351
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So let's take a look at pop 2014 again.

352
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
These are accounts, not percents.

353
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What we're going to do is we're going to take two plots on

354
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the same graph.

355
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
These are called overlaid plots.

356
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And so I'm going to plot the males versus age and the

357
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
females versus age.

358
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And to do that, I just have to specify which is the x-axis.

359
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Then every single other column will be plotted as the y-axis.

360
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So there will be a separate graph for every single other column.

361
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So these accounts.

362
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Number of people in each age group and the blue graph represents

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the males and the gold graph represents the females.

364
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So this is another way of visualizing what we just did before

365
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I do that.

366
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Any questions about the call?

367
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
If your data set, so our data set had everything numerical,

368
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
there was a column of ages and then there were numbers.

369
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
If you had a column of names as well, then plot would be

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
unhappy.

371
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So select the things that you want to plot and then work

372
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
with table like that.

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
All right.

374
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So you can see what we saw before.

375
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
That is up to the age of about 40.

376
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
There are fewer females than males.

377
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Around 40, it overlaps.

378
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And then by the end, there are more females than males.

379
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And there's some fluctuation.

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The numbers aren't always the same.

381
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's going to move all about, except there's a plummet here.

382
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That's unusual.

383
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Just a very sharp drop.

384
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And so what we're going to do is we're going to see what was

385
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
happening at those ages.

386
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And these ages are right about here.

387
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So why don't we look at, OK.

388
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Take a look at those numbers.

389
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
See what you spot.

390
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Do you see the plummet?

391
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The very sharp drop, one age to the next.

392
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Where is it?

393
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Which age?

394
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
67.

395
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Right.

396
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
If you look from 67 to 68, you have it's 1.8 million versus

397
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
1.3 million.

398
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Something happened there.

399
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Right.

400
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And there's something else going on.

401
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
71 to 72.

402
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
There's something noticeable going on there.

403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And so what would be very nice to see is who are those people.

404
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And so what we're going to do is we're going to figure out

405
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the bonds.

406
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Right.

407
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So if somebody is 67 in the year 2014, these are only from 2014,

408
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
then you can figure out when they were born by subtracting their age

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
from 2014.

410
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And so we are going to do 2014 minus.

411
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We don't need to do all of them.

412
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't think how about we do 67.

413
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
OK.

414
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Somebody, before we run, there's somebody

415
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
explained to me what's going to happen.

416
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
2040 is a number, I'm subtracting off what type of object.

417
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's an array.

418
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And so what is that operation going to do?

419
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Element-wise, one element at a time, right?

420
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So it is going to return what?

421
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's going to evaluate to what?

422
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
An array.

423
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And the first element of that array is going to be 2014 minus 67.

424
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The second element of the array is going to be 2014 minus 68 and so on.

425
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And what's the purpose of doing this?

426
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's to find out what these people were born in.

427
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So take a look at that.

428
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
1942 to about 1947.

429
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What was going on in the United States in those years?

430
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
War.

431
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Right?

432
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So Pearl Harbor was in 1941.

433
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And so if you look at the oldest people, the 72-year-olds,

434
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
that's what you're seeing there.

435
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And then there's some number of bits.

436
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And so the war ends around here.

437
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Everybody gets home.

438
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It takes a while to have a baby.

439
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And then in 1947, suddenly there's a lot of babies.

440
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And that's pretty much what you're seeing here.

441
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So the point of this is not just to show you the method calls,

442
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
but to notice that something as,

443
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
suddenly, prosaic as census data can tell stories if you look at them

444
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and ask questions.

445
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And so we encourage you when you look at any data set to ask why

446
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
to notice unusual blips and to ask why they are.

447
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And sometimes you learn something quite interesting.

448
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
OK.

449
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We had one data set that had everybody in it.

450
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What we're going to look.

451
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
This is now looking at the change from 2010 to 2014.

452
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So.

453
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Is somebody watching YouTube?

454
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And if you insist on doing that, it's called earbuds.

455
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Thank you.

456
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
All right.

457
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So this column represents the change in population between 2010 and 2014.

458
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And no surprise there, the biggest change was at 67 years old

459
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:50,000
because the 67 years old in 2014, those are not the same people.

460
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
How old were they in 2010?

461
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Sorry?

462
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
63.

463
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
You have a jump there.

464
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And so what I'd like you to do is I'm not going to dwell on this particular column now.

465
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What you're noticing is that what I'd like you to do as an exercise at home

466
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
is to see how you can reconcile this with what we just said.

467
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The 67-year-olds, there was a jump there.

468
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This is another way of looking at the same element.

469
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
What I'd like to do is actually I would like to look at growth rates because I have heard from

470
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
core staff that people are unhappy about growth rates.

471
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Instead of looking just at absolute change, I would like to look at rate of change here.

472
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And before I do that, I'd like to ask your patients, I want to take you through a little discussion of what growth

473
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
rates are and how that calculation comes about.

474
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And then we're going to use it.

475
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I've heard from numerous staff that growth rates caused unhappiness.

476
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So, okay, let's see if we can be a little less unhappy.

477
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So, a rate you can think of as a percent or a proportion.

478
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So, there's some growth rate.

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Don't worry about the letters.

480
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Just think of it as 3%.

481
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
If a population you start at a certain point, you have some initial value.

482
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And you end up at a certain point after a specified period of time, then you have grown.

483
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And you have grown, we say, at a certain rate.

484
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And what we're going to do is figure out what that means.

485
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Okay, so after one time period, just assume that you start with something that we're calling x.

486
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You can take it to be 100 if you wish.

487
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
After one time period, you have your x plus you have 3% of x.

488
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Okay, so that's the total population that you have.

489
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And a little bit of pulling out the x says that after one period you have,

490
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
what you started with initially times one plus the growth.

491
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So, what I'd like to do is just fix the growth rate to be 3% in our heads.

492
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
For an example, if I start out with a thousand people,

493
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:27,000
then what I have at the end of one period is 1,000 people times 1.03.

494
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Right?

495
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And that is the base of the calculation.

496
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
At every period, you see, what am I starting with now?

497
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And then you multiply that by one plus the rate.

498
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And so therefore, you agree?

499
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
At the second period, you are starting out with where you were at the end of the first period.

500
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And so you were at x times 1 plus g.

501
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So 1,000 times 1.03.

502
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So you take that number and you multiply that again by 1.03.

503
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Questions about this line?

504
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
This is the crucial line and everything else is just okay,

505
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
so now we're going to do it for a bunch of periods.

506
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So for the third period, I'm going to take this as my starting point

507
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
because that's how many people I have now and I'm going to multiply it by another 1 plus g.

508
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And so I'll get a 1 plus g cubed and so on.

509
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And so if you have t, this is t for time period,

510
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
if you have t periods, then at the end of t period,

511
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
you'll have your initial initial starting point, which is x,

512
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and then your 1 plus your growth rate, 1.03,

513
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
to the power of your time periods.

514
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And so what does this do? This says, if you know your initial point,

515
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
that is how many people you had at the start, that's x.

516
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And you know the growth rate, right?

517
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You know that you're going to be increasing at 3% a year.

518
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Then this is what helps you figure out where you're going to end up.

519
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
This is what helps you figure out what your ending point is going to be.

520
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So this is what I call the forwards direction calculation.

521
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I know where I'm starting, I know what the rate's going to be,

522
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I figure out where I'm going to end up.

523
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Very often, we know where we're starting, we know where we ended up,

524
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and the question that comes up is, what did the rate have to be to make this possible?

525
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That is what I call the backwards calculation.

526
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I know the start, I know the end, I don't know the rate,

527
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
but maybe I can figure out what did the rate have to be to get from this particular start to this particular end.

528
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And so for that, what you have to do is you basically have to solve for G in this equation.

529
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And so the next thing that I'm going to write down, if you don't like solving for stuff, just tune out.

530
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
But if you do like solving for stuff, then you can see that this is just, I'm just going backwards.

531
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You will never have to do this in this class.

532
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm just, there are some people in the room who find it more reassuring if they know where stuff came from,

533
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
so I'm just telling you where it comes from.

534
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And so this back calculation is what leads to the formula that you have been using in your labs for growth rate,

535
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
which is to figure out what rate could have got you from initial x to ending y.

536
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You take ending divided by initial, raise it to this funny power, which is one over the time periods,

537
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and take the whole thing and subtract off one.

538
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's where that thing comes from.

539
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If we ask you to do growth rates in exams, we will provide you with the formula.

540
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You don't have to worry about it, right?

541
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But I want you, you should have some sense of where these things come from,

542
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:59,000
and this is a little description of where it comes from, say, two minutes for questions.

543
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah.

544
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Did that give you a little growth rate from the beginning,

545
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
not just the growth rate from the period?

546
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This is the annual, so I just think of periods as years.

547
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
This is the annual growth rate that would, if you were compounded,

548
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
would have led you from x to y in T periods.

549
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It is a per year rate.

550
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Okay, so we're just going to apply this thing.

551
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You've done it before in lab, I just want to make sure that we're okay with doing this.

552
00:38:39,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Okay, so here, so we're going from 2010 to 2014,

553
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:21,000
so it's going to be everyone.

554
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Why did I do that?

555
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Tell column two divided by dot column one, why did I do that?

556
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm not done yet, but why did I do this?

557
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That's taking the end value dividing by the initial value that we said we had to do,

558
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and then what we have to do to this?

559
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
We have to raise it to a power.

560
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yep.

561
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
One over how many time periods were there.

562
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
If we're looking for an annual growth rate, how many time periods were there?

563
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Excuse me, now you can see.

564
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Four, there were four time periods.

565
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
After having done all that, we have to subtract off one from this,

566
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and what we're going to do is we're going to look at sort.

567
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Okay, I'm going to shut up, look at that.

568
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
See what needs to change, see what that's telling you.

569
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:28,000
There's something a little alarming about that.

570
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Okay, why have we done here that isn't working out correctly?

571
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You know, I'm not happy about this at all.

572
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Where did I make everyone?

573
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah, just a moment, let me just come back to where I was.

574
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yes, yes, yes, there's a parenthesis issue.

575
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm just trying to recompute the, it's this.

576
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Okay, so we were all unhappy because of why?

577
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Because the minus signs.

578
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yes, the populations are increasing, you can't have minuses.

579
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Something was wrong in that calculation.

580
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And because of the, this thing doesn't fix itself going back up,

581
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I had to recalculate the entire table and come back down,

582
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and I didn't want to do run all above.

583
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
So, okay, let's try this.

584
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's much better.

585
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Much better.

586
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Positive growth rate because you can see from 2010 to 2014,

587
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the numbers are higher.

588
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yep, okay, all of these are around 0.07, 0.06.

589
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Where's the highest rate of growth?

590
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The very, very, very, very senior people.

591
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And if you compare to, like the 1960s,

592
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the people in those age groups, like 9900,

593
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and the people who are 100 and up,

594
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
they have grown by almost 75%.

595
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
There's a very significant growth in that age group.

596
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And this is, you know, a very vivid picture of the grain of America.

597
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Okay, so what I'd like to do today is we've had a lot of discussion of

598
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
wars, people getting old, and so on and so forth,

599
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and at your age group, it's a little depressing.

600
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So, I want to look at something a little more and light,

601
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but yes.

602
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:20,000
No, we're looking at annual growth rate.

603
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
For you.

604
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
For you.

605
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
For you.

606
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Rate for you.

607
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Annual rate.

608
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay, let's quickly summarize, actually not summarize.

609
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
There are, there's language that we just use.

610
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I want it on slides, so that you know.

611
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That is actually statistical terminology,

612
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and not just some terms that we're making up here.

613
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Types of data.

614
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You know that everything in the column should have the same type,

615
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and be comparable in some way.

616
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We are now bringing that in because you've had ages of 23 and 54,

617
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and a so-called age of 999, and you shouldn't be working with that

618
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
999 at the same time as the 23 and 54.

619
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Okay, numerical.

620
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Numerical measurements.

621
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
They're on the real line necessarily.

622
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
They're ordered.

623
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
53 is bigger than 21.

624
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Differences matter, right?

625
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
There is a, it's a length or a time period difference.

626
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Categorical is like if you are looking at favorite colors,

627
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
so categories, red, blue, green.

628
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Each value is from a fixed inventory.

629
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It just means that there are, you know, there are, you have a total set of five colors,

630
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
and each person will give you one of those five colors.

631
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
May or may not have an ordering.

632
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So here's some categorical data.

633
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
You do a little rating of something, and you are not satisfied.

634
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Some what's satisfied, very satisfied.

635
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Those are categories, but they have a natural ordering.

636
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And so some categories may be ordered, but red, blue, green is not necessarily ordered.

637
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Categories are the same or different.

638
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Well, so are numbers.

639
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But the point is you can't have fractional differences in between, right?

640
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You're either in this category or you're in that, and we will choose a category

641
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
so that we don't have a collapse.

642
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Okay, so this is now so-called numerical data.

643
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Just because the data on numbers doesn't mean the variable is numerical,

644
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
so your sex code had number 0, 1, 2, but you can't subtract and take averages

645
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
of those numbers. It doesn't make sense.

646
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
They're just labels, and you could just as well have called them red, blue, and green.

647
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And so one of the things that happens is there's a big discussion as to whether

648
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
course evaluations of teachers, how they should be summarized.

649
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So at the end of the term, you have to do a course evaluation.

650
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And there's a, you know, would you rate the effectiveness of this course,

651
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and there's like a one through five scale?

652
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yep.

653
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So you're giving back a number, and it sure looks like a number, but it's a category, right?

654
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's your rating of that person.

655
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I use somewhat satisfied, very satisfied.

656
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Basically, it's a category. And then what we get back are averages of those numbers,

657
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
and we're looking at that going, I'm not really very sure what this average means.

658
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Because after all, one person's four, and somebody else's four,

659
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
might mean quite different things, right?

660
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And in any case, those numbers don't make any sense.

661
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So there are, it just keeps us in mind.

662
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And so the variable sex is still categorical, even though the numbers were used for categories.

663
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Okay, so we know how to do line plots.

664
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We're now going to quickly see another kind of plot, and I hope to get you something interesting.

665
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
We have just about enough time. Okay.

666
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So you will have noticed, you will have noticed that I'm really bad at typing,

667
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
like really bad at typing, especially in a lecture in front of 700 people.

668
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
It just doesn't work.

669
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So when the function calls are simple, and there's really not much new going on,

670
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
you will often find that I've already populated the notebook.

671
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I will take you through what is typed there, and then we'll hit return.

672
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So that you don't have to go through me going back and correcting my own mistakes over and over again.

673
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Okay.

674
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to, there's a table called Actors.

675
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
We are going to take a look at these people.

676
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
There are 50 actors in this table, and about 2015, they were the people that had.

677
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Okay, so now let me explain what the columns are.

678
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So there's a name of the actor.

679
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Total gross.

680
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That's not the amount of money that the actor makes.

681
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's the total amount made by the movies that the actor was in.

682
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And that is in millions of dollars.

683
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Then there's a number of movies that actor has been in.

684
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:09,000
The average per movie is among that actor's movies, what was the average amount made by the movies?

685
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And the number one movie is this actor was in a bunch of movies.

686
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
One of them had the highest gross amount, which one was that, and that's there.

687
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And then I think it's, I think what did that one gross?

688
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
They're highest grossing movie.

689
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
What did that one gross?

690
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And so there were, there's a table with the 50 highest ones in about 2015.

691
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And you can see most of them are guys.

692
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
There's a few women as well on the list.

693
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Okay.

694
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So what I would like to do is I would like to draw a scatter diagram.

695
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
What I'm going to look at is, well, we're going to take a look at this diagram.

696
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And then we're going to see exactly what it's doing.

697
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
This is called a scatter. It is not a line plot on the horizontal axis.

698
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
We're going to have number of movies.

699
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And on the vertical axis, we're going to have the total amount grossed by the movie.

700
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
This is a scatter of points like a cloud.

701
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It's often called a cloud.

702
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Each point represents one actor.

703
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And it's basically like plotting points on an XY grid on the horizontal axis.

704
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
You have number of movies.

705
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And on the vertical, you have the total amount grossed.

706
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Okay. So who was the top here?

707
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It was Harrison Ford.

708
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
41 movies.

709
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Top grossing was about there.

710
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So can we find Harrison Ford here?

711
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
41 top gross in this one.

712
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Agreed.

713
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay.

714
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I'd like you to take a look at that scatter.

715
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
What that is showing is called positive association.

716
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
The more movies, in general, the more total amount of money.

717
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Right? You can see that there is a trend.

718
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
The two variables are associated.

719
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
There is some relation between them.

720
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Association was the word that we had in our second lecture when we started out.

721
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
This is positive association.

722
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
No surprise.

723
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The more movies, the more total amount made.

724
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So what we're going to do now is we are going to look at a different scatter diagram.

725
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Number of movies versus the average amount made per movie.

726
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Again, every point is going to be an actor.

727
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Ooh, very different.

728
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Very different.

729
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Negative association.

730
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So there's a point for every actor.

731
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And what you're seeing in this is that the more movies those actors made,

732
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
on average the less those movies made.

733
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So you can see the negative association.

734
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And there is one point that is just screaming at you.

735
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Yes?

736
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You see this?

737
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Screaming at you.

738
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Shall we find out who that is?

739
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Because this person is the boss of this diagram.

740
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Small number of movies and through the roof, average gross.

741
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Okay.

742
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So tell me if that, you think that is a good call.

743
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Actors are where the average per movie above 400.

744
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Look good? Yes? All right.

745
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Anthony Daniels.

746
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Anthony Daniels.

747
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Don't look at me like who's Anthony Daniels.

748
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
What do you mean?

749
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Anthony Daniels is the boss of this diagram.

750
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Small number of movies.

751
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
A ton of money per movie.

752
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
All right.

753
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
What is, whoa.

754
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
What is the data science lesson?

755
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Pay attention to what's being measured.

756
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You're not measuring what the actor makes.

757
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You're measuring what the movies make.

758
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
This actor is only in the Star Wars franchise.

759
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Every single one is a blockbuster.

760
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
On average through the roof.

761
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Okay.

762
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Guys, I want to say something about Friday.

763
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Friday people go through the following calculation.

764
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I've done my lab.

765
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's Friday.

766
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I got other stuff.

767
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't need to come.

768
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Here's what I'm going to say.

769
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
This particular Friday is on histograms.

770
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
People make this calculation every term.

771
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And they look at it and go, that's a bar graph, I understand.

772
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
We have found that this topic causes trouble on homeworks, labs,

773
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and especially the midterm.

774
00:53:36,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Please show up.

775
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
All right.

776
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Thank you.

777
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
All right.

778
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Thank you.

779
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Thank you.

780
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Thank you.

781
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
All right.

782
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
All right.

783
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:14,000
All right.
